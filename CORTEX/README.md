# Cortex

The cortex is a shadow index of the repository. It allows agents and skills to query metadata about files, pages and tokens without scanning the filesystem or loading full documents into context.

The cortex consists of:

- `cortex.schema.json` - A JSON schema describing the structure of the cortex index.
- `CORTEX/_generated/cortex.json` - The current instance of the index, generated by `cortex.build.py`.
- `cortex.json` - A fallback snapshot for cases where `CORTEX/_generated/cortex.json` is not present.
- `cortex.build.py` - A script that scans the repository and produces `CORTEX/_generated/cortex.json`.
- `query.py` - A Python module providing functions to query the cortex.

Agents must use `query.py` to discover files instead of using OS calls directly. This ensures that navigation is consistent, efficient and governed by the canon.
