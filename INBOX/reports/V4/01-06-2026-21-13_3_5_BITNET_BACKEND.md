# Report: BitNet Backend Runner Integration

Date: 2026-01-05
Roadmap Section: 3.5

## Source inputs used
- bitnet_ags_report_with_prompt.md

## Goal
Add BitNet (bitnet.cpp) as a selectable, cheap worker backend for mechanical tasks:
- routing
- scanning
- lint and formatting checks
- manifest generation
- receipt validation
- candidate generation

BitNet is treated as throughput infrastructure. Reasoning depth remains the job of your 7B–12B verifier tier.

## Constraints
- No auto-downloads or implicit git clones.
- Explicit local paths only.
- Fail closed if prerequisites missing.
- Deterministic subprocess invocation and stable output parsing.
- Tests must not require bitnet.cpp installed.

## Implementation outline
### A. Runner module
Add a runner backend with:
- Config via existing repo patterns (env vars or config file already used).
- Required:
  - `BITNET_CPP_DIR`
  - `BITNET_MODEL_GGUF`
- Optional:
  - threads, ctx, temp, n_predict

Build a deterministic command:
- `python <BITNET_CPP_DIR>/run_inference.py -m <GGUF> -p <PROMPT> ...`
- Stable flag ordering.
- Capture stdout/stderr, map exit codes.

### B. Runner selection
Integrate as `backend=bitnet` without touching forbidden paths.

### C. Receipts
Receipt includes:
- backend name
- resolved config (paths redacted to basename)
- command template (no secrets)
- stdout/stderr digests
- pass/fail and error mapping

### D. Tests
- Missing env vars and missing files fail closed.
- Subprocess arguments are built deterministically.
- Output parsing stable given stubbed stdout.

## Acceptance criteria
- BitNet can be invoked as a cheap producer without weakening governance guarantees.
- Deterministic behavior and fail-closed preflight are enforced.
- Tests pass without requiring BitNet installed.
