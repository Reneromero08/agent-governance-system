  "title": "Add Cortex Connection Guidance to AGENTS.md",
  "description": "AGENTS.md currently lacks guidance on how new agents connect to the cortex, creating a circular dependency. Agents need to read AGENTS.md to operate but cannot read it without first connecting to the cortex. This task implements the missing 'Section 0: Initial Connection & Cortex Access' and updates the startup sequence. Aligns with ADR-021 (Mandatory Agent Identity) by documenting the connection process that establishes session tracking.",

  "notes": "This addresses a critical bootstrap failure in the Agent Governance System. The circular dependency (need to read AGENTS.md to operate but need to connect to read it) has been identified as a high-priority gap. Implementation completed with additional improvements:\n\n1. **Section 0 Added**: 'Initial Connection & Cortex Access' with connection methods, tools, troubleshooting\n2. **Section 1 Updated**: Expanded startup sequence to include 8 essential canon documents and 5 key ADRs\n3. **ADR-021 Gap Documented**: Noted critical UUID discovery gap (agents can't know their own session_id)\n4. **Additional Governance References**: Added references to INBOX_POLICY, IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS, STEWARDSHIP, CRISIS, and engineering standards\n5. **Engineering Practices**: Added note about STEWARDSHIP.md engineering culture requirements\n\n**Additional Findings**:\n- ADR-021 implementation has a critical gap: agents cannot discover their own UUIDs\n- Multiple canon documents were missing from AGENTS.md startup sequence\n- Engineering standards from STEWARDSHIP.md were not referenced\n- Crisis/quarantine procedures were not mentioned\n- INBOX policy and implementation report requirements were not documented\n\n**Recommendations for Future**:\n1. Implement `session_info` MCP tool to expose session_id to agents\n2. Consider adding Cortex Quick Reference appendix to AGENTS.md\n3. Create onboarding test to verify new agents can bootstrap successfully",
