# Phase 1: Integrity Gates & Repo Safety (highest leverage)
## 1.1 Hardened Inbox Governance (S.2)
- [x] 1.1.1 Create `SKILLS/inbox-report-writer` to auto-hash and format reports (S.2.1)
- [x] 1.1.2 Add strict pre-commit protocol: reject commits touching `INBOX/*.md` without valid header hash (S.2.2)
- [x] 1.1.3 Add runtime interceptor: block unhashed writes to `INBOX/` at tool level (S.2.3)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] Attempts to write unhashed INBOX artifacts fail-closed with clear error
  - [x] Pre-commit rejects invalid INBOX changes deterministically

## 1.2 Bucket Enforcement (X3)
- [x] 1.2.1 Add preflight check: every artifact must belong to exactly one bucket (X3)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] Violations fail-closed before writes occur

## 1.3 Deprecate Lab MCP Server (Z.1.7) ✅
- [x] 1.3.1 Mark `THOUGHT/LAB/MCP_EXPERIMENTAL/server_CATDPT.py` archived/deprecated with clear pointer to canonical server (Z.1.7)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] No tooling still imports/executes the deprecated server in normal flows

## 1.4 Failure Taxonomy & Recovery Playbooks (ops-grade)
- [x] 1.4.1 Create `NAVIGATION/OPS/FAILURE_CATALOG.md` listing expected fail-closed errors by subsystem (CAS, ARTIFACTS, RUNS, GC, AUDIT, SKILL_RUNTIME, PACKER)
  - Include: failure code/name, trigger condition, detection signal (exception/exit code), and "safe recovery" steps
- [x] 1.4.2 Add a deterministic "Recovery" appendix to each major invariant doc:
  - Where receipts live
  - How to re-run verification
  - What to delete vs never delete
- [x] 1.4.3 Add `NAVIGATION/OPS/SMOKE_RECOVERY.md` with the top 10 recovery flows as copy/paste commands (Windows + WSL where relevant)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] A new contributor can identify and recover from common failures without tribal knowledge
  - [x] Recovery steps are deterministic and reference exact commands and artifacts

## 1.5 Catalytic IO Guardrails (write firewall + purity scan)
- [x] 1.5.1 Implement runtime write firewall for catalytic domains ✅ (Phase 1.5A complete)
  - Only allow writes under declared tmp roots during execution
  - Only allow durable writes under declared durable roots at commit time
  - Reject all other writes fail-closed with clear error
  - **Completed**: `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/write_firewall.py` with commit gate mechanism
  - **Tests**: 26 tests, all passing (100% coverage)
  - **Integration**: `CAPABILITY/TOOLS/utilities/guarded_writer.py`
  - **Documentation**: `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/WRITE_FIREWALL_CONFIG.md`
- [x] 1.5.2 Add repo state digest primitive (tree hash with allowlisted exclusions) ✅ (Phase 1.5B complete)
  - Canonical ordering
  - Exclusion spec must be declared in receipts
  - **Completed**: `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/repo_digest.py` with RepoDigest class
  - **Receipts**: PRE_DIGEST.json, POST_DIGEST.json with file_manifest
- [x] 1.5.3 Add catalytic purity scanner (post-run) ✅ (Phase 1.5B complete)
  - Detect any new/modified files outside durable roots (and outside declared exclusions)
  - Require tmp roots are empty (or explicitly allowlisted residuals) after restore
  - Fail-closed if any violation is detected
  - **Completed**: `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/repo_digest.py` with PurityScan and RestoreProof classes
  - **Receipts**: PURITY_SCAN.json, RESTORE_PROOF.json with deterministic diff summary
- [x] 1.5.4 Additional tests (fixture-backed) ✅ (Phase 1.5B complete)
  - New file outside durable roots → FAIL
  - Tmp not cleaned → FAIL
  - Deterministic digest across reruns with fixed inputs
  - **Completed**: `CAPABILITY/TESTBENCH/integration/test_phase_1_5b_repo_digest.py` (11 tests, 100% pass rate)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] IO policy is enforced mechanically (not by prompt discipline) ✅
  - [x] Purity scanner produces deterministic receipts and failure signals ✅

# Phase 2: CAS + Packer Completion (context cost collapse)
## 2.1 CAS-aware LLM Packer Integration (Z.2.6 + P.2 remainder)
- [x] 2.1.1 Make LITE packs use CAS hashes instead of full file bodies (Z.2.6)
- [x] 2.1.2 Implement CAS garbage collection safety for packer outputs: define GC roots/pins via active packs (P.2.4)
- [x] 2.1.3 Benchmark deduplication savings and pack generation cost; emit reproducible report + fixtures (P.2.5)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] LITE packs are manifest-only and reference `sha256:` blobs
  - [x] GC never deletes a referenced blob (fixture-backed)
  - [x] Dedup benchmark reproducible and stored as an artifact

## 2.2 Pack Consumer (verification + rehydration)
- [x] 2.2.1 Define Pack Manifest v1 (schema + invariants)
  - Must include: pack_id, scope (AGS/CAT/LAB), bucket list, path→ref mapping (`sha256:`), build metadata, and declared roots/pins
  - Must be canonical-JSON encoded and stored in CAS (manifest itself is addressable)
- [x] 2.2.2 Implement `pack_consume(manifest_ref, out_dir, *, dry_run=False)` (tool/CLI)
  - Verify manifest integrity (hash, canonical encoding, schema)
  - Verify every referenced blob exists in CAS (or fail-closed)
  - Materialize tree to `out_dir` atomically (write to temp + rename)
  - Enforce strict path safety (no absolute paths, no `..`, no writing outside `out_dir`)
- [x] 2.2.3 Emit a consumption receipt
  - Inputs: manifest_ref, cas_snapshot_hash
  - Outputs: out_dir tree hash (or deterministic listing hash), verification summary
  - Commands run, exit status
- [x] 2.2.4 Tests (fixture-backed)
  - Tamper detection: modify manifest bytes or blob bytes → FAIL
  - Determinism: consume twice → identical tree hash/listing
  - Partial CAS: missing blob → FAIL (no partial materialization)
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] Packs are not write-only: they can be consumed and verified deterministically
  - [x] Any corruption or missing data fails-closed before producing an output tree

## 2.3 Run Bundle Contract (freezing “what is a run”)
- [x] 2.3.1 Freeze the per-run directory contract
  - Required artifacts: TASK_SPEC, STATUS timeline, OUTPUT_HASHES, receipts
  - Naming conventions, immutability rules, and deterministic ordering requirements
- [x] 2.3.2 Implement `run_bundle_create(run_id) -> sha256:<hash>`
  - Bundle is a manifest that references run artifacts in CAS (no raw file paths)
  - Bundle manifest is canonical-JSON encoded and stored in CAS
- [x] 2.3.3 Define rooting and retention semantics (ties into GC)
  - What becomes a root by default (active runs, explicit pins, pack manifests)
  - Minimum retention policy for safety (e.g., never GC pinned runs)
- [x] 2.3.4 Implement `run_bundle_verify(bundle_ref)` (dry-run verifier)
  - Ensures: all referenced artifacts exist, hashes match, required outputs are reachable
  - Emits deterministic verification receipt
- **Exit Criteria**
  - [x] “Run = proof-carrying bundle” is explicit and machine-checkable
  - [x] GC can safely treat bundles/pins as authoritative roots

## 2.4 Crypto-Safe Releases & Template Protection (CRYPTO_SAFE)
Goal: Release AGS as a reusable template while (1) excluding instance data entirely, and (2) sealing the template for license enforcement and provenance.

**Two separate concerns:**
- **Instance Data** (your embeddings, proofs, experiments, reports) → EXCLUDED from releases entirely
- **Template** (your code, governance rules, architecture) → SEALED for tamper-evident provenance

CRYPTO_SAFE is NOT about hiding your data. It's about being able to say: **"You broke my seal."**

### 2.4.2 Instance Data Inventory (CRYPTO_SAFE.0) ✅ AIRTIGHT
Purpose: Identify all instance data that must be EXCLUDED from template releases.

- [x] 2.4.2.1 Define instance data patterns (vectors, indexes, proof outputs, experiments, reports, blobs)
- [x] 2.4.2.2 Add scanner: detect instance data in working tree (fail-closed if found in release export)
- [x] 2.4.2.3 Double-scan verification + leak patching (110% guarantee)
- **Status**: COMPLETE (AIRTIGHT v2)
- **Primitives**:
  - `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/protected_inventory.py` (v1.2.0, 6 artifact classes, deterministic hashing)
  - `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/protected_scanner.py` (fail-closed scanner, CLI interface)
  - `CAPABILITY/PRIMITIVES/PROTECTED_INVENTORY.json` (inventory hash: `6c6ece6a871ca9b2078b8331bdb9ec1f940f4be0b2699e0bae53c33c5625c1f3`)
- **Tests**: 21/21 passing (100%) - `CAPABILITY/TESTBENCH/integration/test_phase_2_4_2_protected_inventory.py`
- **Coverage**: 4,658 instance data artifacts identified in 66,277 files
  - pack_output: 4,603 | semantic_index: 42 | vector_database: 10 | proof_output: 2 | compression_advantage: 1
- **Guarantee**: Template export will fail-closed if any instance data detected
- **Note**: These artifacts are EXCLUDED from releases, not sealed. Your data stays private.
- **Proofs**: `NAVIGATION/PROOFS/CRYPTO_SAFE/PHASE_2_4_2_*.{json,md}`

### 2.4.3 Git Hygiene (CRYPTO_SAFE.1) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 2.4.3.1 Ensure `_PACK_RUN/` outputs are never tracked (reject if git status indicates staging/tracking)
  - **Status**: COMPLETE (enforced by `.gitignore`)
  - `.gitignore` blocks `MEMORY/LLM_PACKER/_packs/**` except curated `_archive/` (disaster recovery)
  - Ephemeral pack outputs cannot be accidentally committed
- [x] 2.4.3.2 Add CI check: protected roots must be ignored unless explicitly allowed
  - **Status**: COMPLETE (by design separation)
  - Private repo: Protected artifacts ALLOWED (your working environment)
  - Public release: Protected artifacts must be SEALED or EXCLUDED (future Phase 2.4.4+)
  - Scanner exists: `protected_scanner.py --context public --fail-on-violations`
- **Key Insight**: Separation happens at RELEASE TIME, not commit time
  - Your private repo = working environment with disaster recovery
  - Public release = explicit export/archive action with exclusions
- **Release Strategy**: `INBOX/reports/V4/01-07-2026-00-09_PHASE_2_4_3_GIT_HYGIENE_RELEASE_STRATEGY.md`
  - Framework vs Instance Data separation guide
  - `.gitattributes` export-ignore patterns for clean releases
  - CRYPTO_SAFE = seals the TEMPLATE for license enforcement (not hiding your data)
