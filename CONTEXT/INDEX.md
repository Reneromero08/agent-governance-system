# Context Index

This file serves as the table of contents for the `CONTEXT/` directory. Each subdirectory captures a different type of context record:

- `decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document choices and their rationale. Use `ADR-000-template.md` as a starting point.
- `rejected/` - Documents that record ideas that were considered and consciously rejected. Use `REJECT-000-template.md` as a starting point.
- `preferences/` - Statements of style, conventions or non-binding preferences. Use `STYLE-000-template.md` as a starting point.
- `open/` - Open questions or unresolved discussions.
- `research/` - Non-binding research threads, model notes and external references.
- `archive/` - Archived snapshots of prior context/planning documents.

To navigate context files programmatically, refer to the index or query the cortex. Human readers can browse the subdirectories directly.
