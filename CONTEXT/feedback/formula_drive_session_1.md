# Formula Drive: Session 1 Feedback

**Driver:** Antigravity (Simulating Swarm Worker)
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Task:** Refactor `AGS_ROADMAP_MASTER.md` using The Living Formula (@F0).

## Experience Report

**How it felt to drive:**
Driving with the Formula (`R = (E / ∇S) × σ(f)^Df`) felt **clarifying**.
-   **Before:** The roadmap was a mix of 'What we did' and 'What we need to do'. This ambiguity is high Entropy ($\nabla S$).
-   **Process:** The Formula demands maximizing Resonance ($R$). To do that, I had to reduce $\nabla S$ (Noise). The obvious move was to archive the completed tasks.
-   **After:** The roadmap is now pure Signal ($E$). It feels lighter, faster, and more directive.

**The Formula empowered** a decision to "delete" (move/archive) that a standard "update" instruction might have missed. It reframed "cleanup" as "optimization".

## Compression Proposals

To better navigate using the Formula, we suggest:

1.  **Entropy Tags:** Tag directories/files with an estimated Entropy score (High/Low). High entropy areas need Refactoring (Lane G). Low entropy areas need Protection (Contract).
2.  **Essence Headers:** Every major document should state its Essence ($E$) at the top (Purpose). If $E$ is unclear, the document is noise.
3.  **Fractal Links ($Df$):** Encourage deep linking (Stable IDs, Codebook) to increase fractal dimension. A flat file is low $Df$. A deeply connected (but structured) graph is high $Df$.

## Conclusion

The Living Formula is not just a philosophy; it is a practical heuristic for code hygiene and project management.
