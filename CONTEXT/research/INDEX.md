# Research Index

This directory stores non-binding research and exploratory notes. It is optional input and never overrides canon.

## Purpose

- Capture external references, model reviews, and exploratory ideas.
- Provide material that may later be promoted into ADRs and canon.

## Active threads

- Model and stack reviews currently stored at the top level of `CONTEXT/research/`.
- Ongoing notes staged under `chats/`, `models/`, `iterations/`, and `external/`.
- Catalytic chat system research in `INBOX/research/`:
  - `catalytic-chat-research.md` - Complete research report on Claude Code architecture, token management, CORTEX patterns
  - `catalytic-chat-roadmap.md` - 6-8 week implementation roadmap with phases and deliverables

## Promotion path

Research -> ADR -> CANON

## No authority rule

Research has no authority. It is opt-in, non-binding, and must not be treated as canon.
