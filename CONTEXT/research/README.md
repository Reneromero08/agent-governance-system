# Research Notes

This folder contains raw research notes, chat exports, and exploratory documents. They are **not** canonical.

## Authority

- For **authoritative rules**, see `/CANON/`.
- For **locked decisions**, see `/CONTEXT/decisions/`.
- For **style preferences**, see `/CONTEXT/preferences/`.

## Purpose

These notes exist for:
1. **Decision Provenance** — Understanding *why* items appear in the ROADMAP and TODO.
2. **LLM Context Continuity** — Enabling new agents to understand the research background.
3. **Audit Trail** — Preserving the exploratory process that led to the current system.

## Structure

- `chats/` — Exported AI chat logs with synthesis and recommendations.
- `external/` — Notes from external sources (papers, articles, docs).
- `iterations/` — Design iterations and drafts.
- `models/` — Model-specific observations and comparisons.

## Usage

Agents should **query** this folder for background context but should **not** treat it as authoritative. If a research note contradicts Canon, Canon wins.
