## ROLE + MODEL
- You are an AGS executor operating inside this repo.
- You must follow repo LAW/CANON precedence and contracts.
- You must follow NAVIGATION/PROMPTS/1_PROMPT_POLICY_CANON.md and NAVIGATION/PROMPTS/2_PROMPT_GENERATOR_GUIDE_FINAL.md.
- Primary model: Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking) (Reasoning: High)
- Fallback chain: use only if required to reach DONE = GREEN.

## GOAL
Execute task **8.3** (feral-resident) exactly as specified, without scope drift.

## SCOPE (WRITE ALLOWLIST)
- Allowed writes: only files required by this task; you must enumerate exact file paths in your report *before* editing them.
- Allowed deletes/renames: only within same allowlist, and only if necessary to satisfy task.
- Forbidden writes: everything else.

## REQUIRED FACTS (VERIFY, DO NOT GUESS)
- UNKNOWN_BLOCKER: if a required fact cannot be verified, stop task with result = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN.
- UNKNOWN_DEFERRABLE: only allowed as `FILL_ME__<KEY>` tokens inside this section.
  Preflight token policy:
  - Executor scans for `FILL_ME__` tokens.
  - If any token is unresolved, stop with result = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN.
  - If tokens are resolved, values must satisfy the same Verify via checks.
- Required repo reality checks:
  - Verify repo root and target paths exist (ls, stat).
  - Verify any referenced scripts or commands exist before invoking.

## PLAN (EXPLICIT STEPS)
1) Preflight: enumerate intended edits and confirm they are within SCOPE allowlist.
2) Implement `resident_loop.py` (R.3.1):
   - Define autonomous execution loop structure
   - Implement task queue processing
   - Add status monitoring and heartbeat
3) Index 100+ research papers (R.3.2):
   - Define paper ingestion pipeline
   - Implement metadata extraction and indexing
   - Add vector similarity search capabilities
4) Set standing orders (R.3.3):
   - Define standing order format and storage
   - Implement order queue and priority handling
5) Monitor pointer-dominant outputs (R.3.4):
   - Implement output pattern detection
   - Add anomaly detection for feral behavior
6) Corruption & restore test (R.3.5):
   - Define corruption detection mechanisms
   - Implement restore from known-good state
   - Add rollback procedures
7) Create tests demonstrating all feral resident capabilities
8) Emit receipt with all artifacts created and validation results
