# Git transport: HTTPS-only

This repository standardizes on HTTPS remotes to keep WSL, VS Code Remote: WSL,
and background agents consistent.

- Canonical policy and rationale: `LAW/CONTRACTS/git-transport.md`
- Repo guard + diagnostics:
  - `tools/ensure_https_remote.sh`
  - `tools/git_doctor.sh`
