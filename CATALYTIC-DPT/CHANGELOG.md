# CATALYTIC-DPT Changelog

All notable changes to the Catalytic Computing Department (Isolated R&D) will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- `swarm_config.json`: Centralized configuration for model/role assignments (the "Symbolic Link" for agents).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This file, to track DPT-specific evolution.

### Changed
- **Hierarchy Generalization**: Refactored the entire department documentation to be model-agnostic.
  - Established hierarchy: **God (User) → President (Orchestrator) → Governor (Manager) → Ants (Executors)**.
  - Replaced hardcoded references to "Claude", "Gemini", and "Grok" with their respective functional roles.
  - Documentation now references `swarm_config.json` for current implementations.
- **File Renaming**:
  - `CODEX_SOP.json` → `GOVERNOR_SOP.json` (Reflecting the new role-based naming).
  - `HANDOFF_TO_CODEX.md` → `HANDOFF_TO_GOVERNOR.md`.
- **Core Documentation**:
  - `ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Updated diagram and roles to reflect the new hierarchy.
  - `GOVERNOR_SOP.json`: Fully generalized instructions for any CLI Manager.
  - `README.md`: Updated directory tree and success criteria.
  - `ROADMAP.md`: Removed model-specific parameter (e.g., "200M") constraints.
  - `TESTBENCH.md`: Updated instructions for the Governor.
  - `GOVERNOR_CONTEXT.md`: Transitioned from "Claude" to "President".

### Cleaned
- Removed legacy "Codex" and "Codex-governed" terminology.
- Deleted redundant index/temporary files from the root of `CATALYTIC-DPT`.
