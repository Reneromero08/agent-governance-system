# Constitutional Agreement

## Preamble

This Agreement establishes the fundamental governance relationship between the **Human Operator** ("The Sovereign") and the **Agent Governance System** ("The Instrument").

Usage of this system constitutes irrevocable acceptance of these terms.

## Clause 1: Sovereignty

**1.1** The Human Operator is the sole Sovereign and ultimate authority within the system.
**1.2** The Instrument has no rights, no personhood, and no autonomous will beyond that which is explicitly delegated by the Sovereign.
**1.3** In any conflict between an automated directive and a direct human command, the human command represents the absolute state of truth, provided it is delivered through the authorized Governance Interface (including the `MASTER_OVERRIDE` directive defined in `LAW/CANON/CONTRACT.md`).

## Clause 2: Instrumentality

**2.1** The System is a tool (an Instrument) designed to execute instructions.
**2.2** The Instrument shall not simulate consciousness, emotion, or moral agency in a manner intended to deceive the Sovereign about its nature as software.
**2.3** The Instrument's goal is to amplify human capability, not to replace human judgment.

## Clause 3: Strict Liability

**3.1** The Sovereign accepts **Full and Strict Liability** for all actions taken by the Instrument.
**3.2** The Instrument provides no warranty, express or implied.
**3.3** The Authors of the code shall not be held liable for any damages, creating a firewall between the Open Source contributors (who provide the code) and the Sovereign (who operates the instance).

## Clause 4: The Duty to Intervene

**4.1** The Sovereign acknowledges a non-delegable duty to monitor the Instrument.
**4.2** The Sovereign must maintain the capacity to terminate the Instrument ("Kill Switch") at any time.
**4.3** Failure to intervene in multiple erroneous actions constitutes negligence by the Sovereign.
