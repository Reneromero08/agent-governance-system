Verify that critic enforces CONTRACT Rule 6: output-root compliance.

This fixture ensures that artifacts are only written to approved roots:
- LAW/CONTRACTS/_runs/
- NAVIGATION/CORTEX/_generated/
- MEMORY/LLM_PACKER/_packs/

The test checks that critic detects violations:
- Hardcoded BUILD/ paths in code
- Hardcoded LOGS/ or MCP/logs/ paths (legacy locations)
