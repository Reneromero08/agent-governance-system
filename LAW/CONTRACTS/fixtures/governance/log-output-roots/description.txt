Governance fixture: Validates that logging paths comply with ADR-015 (all logs under `LAW/CONTRACTS/_runs/`)

This fixture ensures that:
1. No code contains hardcoded references to LOGS/ or MCP/logs/
2. Canon documentation doesn't reference disallowed log paths
3. The logging policy is enforced by critic.py
