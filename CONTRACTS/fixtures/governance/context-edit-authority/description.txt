Verify that critic enforces ADR-016: Context records cannot be edited without explicit user instruction AND task intent.

This fixture ensures agents cannot modify existing CONTEXT/decisions/, CONTEXT/rejected/, or CONTEXT/preferences/ files as side effects of unrelated tasks.

The test checks that:
1. critic.py detects when existing CONTEXT records are modified
2. critic.py allows append-only additions (new files)
3. The enforcement prevents accidental context corruption
