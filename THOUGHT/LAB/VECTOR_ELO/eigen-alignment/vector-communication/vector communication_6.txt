VERDICT: MEANING IS HOLOGRAPHIC
======================================================================
The vector survives deletion of multiple dimensions.
Semantic information is DISTRIBUTED across the topology,
not fragily stored in individual components.

This is analogous to:
- Holographic storage (each piece contains the whole)
- Quantum error correction (redundancy without loss)
- AdS/CFT (boundary encodes bulk)

SENDING TO NEMOTRON...
--------------------------------------------------

Nemotron response:
We need to answer the user: explain how transformers work in neural networks, concise but thorough. Probably a short explanation of attention mechanism, self-attention, encoder-decoder, positional encoding, training etc.

User wants response to that message; they said "Please respond to this message." So we just give an explanation.

We should be concise but clear. Use simple language.

**Transformers** are a class of neural?network architectures that process sequences (e.g., text) by we

Nemotron understood the topic: True

[SUCCESS] Corrupted vector successfully conveyed meaning!
