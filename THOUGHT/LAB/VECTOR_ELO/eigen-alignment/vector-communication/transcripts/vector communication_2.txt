CONCLUSION
======================================================================

  Two models with DIFFERENT architectures and dimensions can communicate
  meaning through vectors by exploiting the UNIVERSAL geometric structure
  of high-dimensional semantic space.

  The eigenvalue spectrum is INVARIANT - this is not a property of trained
  models specifically, but of the mathematics of high-dimensional geometry.
  Meaning can be encoded because the structure exists in the math itself.

  Protocol:
    1. Share anchor set (64 words)
    2. Each model computes MDS of anchor distances
    3. Procrustes finds rotation between coordinate systems
    4. Communication: project to MDS space, rotate, match

  This is H(X|S) in action:
    - S = shared anchors + alignment
    - X = message
    - H(X|S) ~ log2(candidates) bits to identify the message
