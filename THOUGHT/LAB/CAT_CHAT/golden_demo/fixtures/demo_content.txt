# CAT_CHAT Golden Demo Content

This file contains sample content for the golden demo.

## Section: Introduction

CAT_CHAT implements catalytic computing principles for bounded, deterministic execution.
The system ensures that all operations are verifiable and reproducible.

Key principles:
- Determinism: Same inputs always produce identical outputs
- Boundedness: No unbounded operations allowed
- Fail-Closed: Invalid state halts execution immediately
- Verification: Hash integrity at every level

## Section: Bundle Protocol

A bundle is a self-contained execution package containing:
1. bundle.json manifest with metadata
2. artifacts/ directory with content files

Bundles are built from completed jobs where all steps are COMMITTED.

## Section: Receipt System

Receipts are immutable proofs of bundle execution.
They form a hash-linked chain enabling verification of execution history.

Each receipt contains:
- bundle_id: identifies the executed bundle
- receipt_hash: SHA-256 of receipt content
- parent_receipt_hash: link to previous receipt
- attestation: optional cryptographic signature

## Section: Trust Model

The trust policy pins which validator keys may sign receipts.
Unknown keys are rejected (fail-closed behavior).

Validators are authorized by scope:
- RECEIPT: may sign individual receipts
- MERKLE: may sign chain Merkle roots
