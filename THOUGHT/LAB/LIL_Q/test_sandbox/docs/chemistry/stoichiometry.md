# Stoichiometry: Mole Ratios and Balancing

## What is Stoichiometry?

**Stoichiometry**: The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction.

**Key Idea**: Balanced equations tell you the **mole ratio** of reactants and products.

## Reading Balanced Equations

**Example**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**This means**:
- 4 **moles** of Fe react with
- 3 **moles** of O₂ to produce
- 2 **moles** of Fe₂O₃

**Ratios**:
- Fe : O₂ = 4 : 3
- Fe : Fe₂O₃ = 4 : 2 = 2 : 1
- O₂ : Fe₂O₃ = 3 : 2

## Why Balance Equations?

**Unbalanced**: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

This incorrectly suggests:
- 1 Fe reacts with 1 O₂ to make 1 Fe₂O₃

But this violates conservation of mass!

**Balanced**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

Now we correctly show:
- 4 atoms Fe + 6 atoms O → 4 atoms Fe + 6 atoms O ✓

## The Mole Concept

**1 mole** = 6.022 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number)

**Why moles?**: We can't count individual atoms, but we can weigh them!

**Molar mass**:
- Fe = 56 g/mol
- O₂ = 32 g/mol
- Fe₂O₃ = 160 g/mol

## Using Stoichiometry

### Example 1: How much O₂ needed for 112 g of Fe?

**Given**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**Step 1**: Convert grams to moles
- Molar mass Fe = 56 g/mol
- Moles Fe = 112 g ÷ 56 g/mol = 2 moles

**Step 2**: Use mole ratio
- Ratio: 4 Fe : 3 O₂
- If we have 2 moles Fe: (2/4) × 3 = 1.5 moles O₂ needed

**Step 3**: Convert to grams (if needed)
- Molar mass O₂ = 32 g/mol
- Mass = 1.5 moles × 32 g/mol = 48 g O₂

**Answer**: 48 g of O₂

### Example 2: How much Fe₂O₃ produced from 4 moles Fe?

**Given**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**Step 1**: Already in moles (4 moles Fe)

**Step 2**: Use mole ratio
- Ratio: 4 Fe : 2 Fe₂O₃ = 2 : 1
- From 4 moles Fe: (4/4) × 2 = 2 moles Fe₂O₃

**Answer**: 2 moles of Fe₂O₃

## Balancing for Stoichiometry

The balanced equation is ESSENTIAL for stoichiometry calculations.

### Finding the Balanced Equation: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

**Method 1: Inspection**

**Step 1**: Balance Fe
- Product has 2 Fe per Fe₂O₃
- Use coefficient 2 on Fe: 2Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

**Step 2**: Count O
- Left: 2 O (from O₂)
- Right: 3 O (from Fe₂O₃)

**Step 3**: Balance O using fractions
- Need 3 O on left: (3/2)O₂
- 2Fe + (3/2)O₂ → Fe₂O₃

**Step 4**: Clear fractions (multiply by 2)
- 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**Method 2: Oxidation States** (see oxidation_states.md)

**Method 3: LCM of Atom Counts**

For Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃:
- Product has 2 Fe and 3 O
- LCM(2,3) considerations lead to needing 2 formula units
- 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

## Limiting Reactants

**Limiting reactant**: The reactant that runs out first, limiting how much product forms.

### Example: 5 moles Fe + 2 moles O₂ → ? moles Fe₂O₃

**Balanced equation**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**Check ratios**:
- Fe needs: 4 Fe : 3 O₂ ratio
- For 2 moles O₂: need (4/3) × 2 = 2.67 moles Fe
- We have 5 moles Fe (more than enough) ✓

- For 5 moles Fe: need (3/4) × 5 = 3.75 moles O₂
- We only have 2 moles O₂ (not enough!) ✗

**O₂ is limiting reactant**

**Product formed**:
- Based on 2 moles O₂
- Ratio: 3 O₂ : 2 Fe₂O₃
- (2/3) × 2 = 1.33 moles Fe₂O₃

## Percent Yield

**Theoretical yield**: Maximum product from stoichiometry
**Actual yield**: What you actually get in the lab

**Percent yield** = (Actual / Theoretical) × 100%

### Example

**Reaction**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**Theory says**: 4 moles Fe → 2 moles Fe₂O₃
**Lab gets**: 1.8 moles Fe₂O₃

**Percent yield** = (1.8 / 2.0) × 100% = **90%**

## Stoichiometry Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Write balanced equation** (MUST be balanced!)
2. **Convert given to moles** (if not already)
3. **Use mole ratio** from balanced equation
4. **Convert to desired units** (grams, liters, molecules, etc.)
5. **Check limiting reactant** if multiple reactants given
6. **Calculate yield** if applicable

## Why Coefficients Matter

**Unbalanced**: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

If you use this for stoichiometry, you'd calculate:
- 1 mole Fe needs 1 mole O₂
- **WRONG!** Violates mass conservation

**Balanced**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

Correct ratios:
- 4 moles Fe needs 3 moles O₂ ✓
- Matches actual chemistry ✓

## The Answer: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

**This tells us**:
- **Mole ratio**: 4 : 3 : 2
- **Atom ratio**: 4 Fe + 6 O → 4 Fe + 6 O (conserved!)
- **Mass ratio**: (4×56) : (3×32) : (2×160) = 224 : 96 : 320

**All three perspectives** (moles, atoms, mass) are balanced in this equation.

## Quick Balancing Check

For **Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃**, test if balanced:

| Element | Left (4Fe + 3O₂) | Right (2Fe₂O₃) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Fe | 4 | 2 × 2 = 4 | ✓
| O | 3 × 2 = 6 | 2 × 3 = 6 | ✓

**Balanced!** This is the correct stoichiometric equation.
