# Oxidation States and Balancing

## What are Oxidation States?

**Oxidation state** (or oxidation number) is the charge an atom would have if all bonds were 100% ionic.

**Why this matters**: Helps balance equations by tracking electron transfer.

## Basic Rules for Oxidation States

### Rule 1: Free Elements = 0
- Fe (iron metal) = 0
- O₂ (oxygen gas) = 0
- H₂ (hydrogen gas) = 0

### Rule 2: Monatomic Ions = Charge
- Na⁺ = +1
- Cl⁻ = -1
- Fe³⁺ = +3

### Rule 3: Oxygen = -2 (Usually)
- In H₂O: O = -2
- In CO₂: O = -2
- Exception: Peroxides (H₂O₂), O = -1

### Rule 4: Hydrogen = +1 (Usually)
- In H₂O: H = +1
- In CH₄: H = +1
- Exception: Metal hydrides (NaH), H = -1

### Rule 5: Sum of Oxidation States = Charge
- For neutral molecule: Sum = 0
- For ion: Sum = charge

## Finding Oxidation States

### Example 1: Fe₂O₃ (Iron(III) Oxide)

**Setup**:
- Let Fe's oxidation state = x
- O's oxidation state = -2 (Rule 3)

**Equation**:
2x + 3(-2) = 0 (neutral molecule, Rule 5)
2x - 6 = 0
2x = 6
**x = +3**

**Answer**: Fe = +3, O = -2

### Example 2: CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide)

**Setup**:
- Let C's oxidation state = x
- O's oxidation state = -2

**Equation**:
x + 2(-2) = 0
x - 4 = 0
**x = +4**

**Answer**: C = +4, O = -2

## Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions

**Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (oxidation state increases)
**Reduction**: Gain of electrons (oxidation state decreases)

**Mnemonic**: **OIL RIG**
- **O**xidation **I**s **L**oss (of electrons)
- **R**eduction **I**s **G**ain (of electrons)

## Analyzing Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

### Step 1: Assign Oxidation States

**Reactants**:
- Fe (free element) = 0
- O₂ (free element) = 0

**Products**:
- Fe in Fe₂O₃ = +3 (calculated above)
- O in Fe₂O₃ = -2

### Step 2: Identify What Changed

- **Fe**: 0 → +3 (lost 3 electrons per Fe) = **OXIDIZED**
- **O**: 0 → -2 (gained 2 electrons per O) = **REDUCED**

### Step 3: Balance Electron Transfer

**Electrons lost by Fe**: Each Fe loses 3 e⁻
**Electrons gained by O**: Each O gains 2 e⁻

To balance electron transfer:
- Need electrons lost = electrons gained
- LCM(3, 2) = 6

**So we need**:
- 2 Fe atoms (lose 2×3 = 6 e⁻)
- 3 O atoms (gain 3×2 = 6 e⁻)

### Step 4: Apply to Equation

We need:
- 2 Fe on left (but Fe₂O₃ already has 2 Fe, so we need 2 Fe₂O₃)
- That's 4 Fe total

For oxygen:
- 2 Fe₂O₃ has 6 O
- So we need 3 O₂ (which gives 6 O)

**Result**: **4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃**

## Why This Works

**Electron balance**:
- 4 Fe atoms lose 4×3 = 12 e⁻
- 6 O atoms gain 6×2 = 12 e⁻

## Another Example: Mg + O₂ → MgO

### Oxidation States

**Before**:
- Mg = 0
- O₂ = 0

**After**:
- Mg = +2
- O = -2

### Electron Transfer

- Mg loses 2 e⁻
- O gains 2 e⁻

**Already balanced!** 1:1 ratio works.

But O comes as O₂, so:

**2**Mg + O₂ → **2**MgO

## Balancing Strategy Using Oxidation States

1. **Assign oxidation states** to all atoms
2. **Identify what's oxidized** (increase) and **reduced** (decrease)
3. **Count electrons transferred**
4. **Find LCM** to balance electron transfer
5. **Apply coefficients** to balance atoms
6. **Verify** atom counts match

## Example: Cu + HNO₃ → Cu(NO₃)₂ + NO + H₂O

### Oxidation States

**Cu**: 0 → +2 (loses 2 e⁻, oxidized)
**N in HNO₃**: +5
**N in NO**: +2 (gains 3 e⁻, reduced)

### Balance Electrons

- Cu loses 2 e⁻
- N gains 3 e⁻
- LCM = 6

Need:
- 3 Cu (lose 6 e⁻)
- 2 N reduced (gain 6 e⁻)

### Full Equation

3Cu + 8HNO₃ → 3Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2NO + 4H₂O

(The 8 HNO₃ is needed to provide enough NO₃⁻ for products plus the N that gets reduced)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Oxidation states help track electron transfer**
2. **Free elements always = 0**
3. **Total electrons lost = total electrons gained**
4. **Use LCM to find smallest coefficients**
5. **This method works even for complex equations**

## The Iron Rust Equation

**4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃**

**Understanding**:
- Each Fe goes from 0 → +3 (loses 3 e⁻)
- Each O goes from 0 → -2 (gains 2 e⁻)
- 4 Fe lose 12 e⁻ total
- 6 O gain 12 e⁻ total
- **Electron transfer is balanced** ✓

This is why iron rusts - it's losing electrons to oxygen!
