# Balancing Chemical Equations

## Why Balance Equations?

**Law of Conservation of Mass**: Atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.

**Unbalanced**: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

This is wrong! On the left we have 1 Fe and 2 O. On the right we have 2 Fe and 3 O. Not balanced!

**Balanced**: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

Now we have 4 Fe and 6 O on both sides. ✓

## The Balancing Process

### Step 1: Count Atoms on Each Side

**Example**: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

| Element | Left Side | Right Side |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Fe | 1 | 2 |
| O | 2 | 3 |

**NOT BALANCED** - numbers don't match

### Step 2: Balance One Element at a Time

**Strategy**: Start with the most complex molecule (usually the product).

**Fe₂O₃** has 2 Fe and 3 O - this is our reference.

### Step 3: Balance Metals First (Fe)

Right side has 2 Fe (in Fe₂O₃)
Left side needs 2 Fe total

**Add coefficient**: **2**Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

| Element | Left | Right |
|---------|------|-------|
| Fe | 2 | 2 | ✓
| O | 2 | 3 | ✗

### Step 4: Balance Non-Metals (O)

Right side has 3 O (in Fe₂O₃)
Left side has O₂ molecules (2 O per molecule)

**Problem**: Need 3 O, but O₂ comes in pairs!

**Solution**: Use fractions temporarily, or multiply everything to get whole numbers.

**Fraction approach**: 2Fe + (3/2)O₂ → Fe₂O₃

This works mathematically but we want whole numbers...

### Step 5: Eliminate Fractions

Multiply ALL coefficients by 2:

2 × 2Fe + 2 × (3/2)O₂ → 2 × Fe₂O₃

**4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃**

### Step 6: Final Check

| Element | Left Side | Right Side |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Fe | 4 | 2×2 = 4 | ✓
| O | 3×2 = 6 | 2×3 = 6 | ✓

**BALANCED!** ✓

## Worked Example: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O

### Initial Count

| Element | Left | Right |
|---------|------|-------|
| H | 2 | 2 | ✓
| O | 2 | 1 | ✗

Hydrogen is balanced, oxygen is not.

### Balance Oxygen

Right side needs 2 O, so we need 2 H₂O molecules:

H₂ + O₂ → **2**H₂O

### Recount

| Element | Left | Right |
|---------|------|-------|
| H | 2 | 2×2 = 4 | ✗
| O | 2 | 2×1 = 2 | ✓

Now oxygen is balanced but hydrogen isn't!

### Balance Hydrogen

Need 4 H on left, so we need 2 H₂ molecules:

**2**H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

### Final Check

| Element | Left | Right |
|---------|------|-------|
| H | 2×2 = 4 | 2×2 = 4 | ✓
| O | 2 | 2×1 = 2 | ✓

**Answer**: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Combustion

General: CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

Balance C first, then H, then O (oxygen often needs fractions initially).

### Pattern 2: Single Replacement

General: A + BC → AC + B

Often straightforward, may need to balance charges in ionic equations.

### Pattern 3: Double Replacement

General: AB + CD → AD + CB

Balance each compound separately.

## Balancing Tips

1. **Start with the most complex molecule** (usually the product)
2. **Save oxygen or hydrogen for last** (they appear in many molecules)
3. **Balance metals first**, then non-metals
4. **Use fractions if needed**, then multiply to get whole numbers
5. **Never change subscripts** (Fe₂O₃ stays Fe₂O₃), only add coefficients
6. **Check your work** - count atoms on both sides at the end

## Example with Multiple Products: C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

### Step 1: Count Initial Atoms

Left: 3 C, 8 H, 2 O
Right: 1 C, 2 H, 3 O (1 CO₂ + 1 H₂O)

### Step 2: Balance Carbon

Need 3 CO₂ on right:

C₃H₈ + O₂ → **3**CO₂ + H₂O

### Step 3: Balance Hydrogen

Need 4 H₂O on right (8 H total):

C₃H₈ + O₂ → 3CO₂ + **4**H₂O

### Step 4: Count Oxygen on Right

- 3CO₂ has 6 O
- 4H₂O has 4 O
- Total: 10 O needed

### Step 5: Balance Oxygen

Need 5 O₂ molecules (10 O total):

C₃H₈ + **5**O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

### Step 6: Verify

| Element | Left | Right |
|---------|------|-------|
| C | 3 | 3 | ✓
| H | 8 | 8 | ✓
| O | 10 | 10 | ✓

**Answer**: C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Changing subscripts**: Fe₂O₃ → Fe₃O₃ (WRONG!)

✓ **Adding coefficients**: Fe₂O₃ → 2Fe₂O₃ (correct)

❌ **Forgetting to multiply**: 2Fe₂O₃ has 4 Fe, not 2!

✓ **Always multiply**: coefficient × subscript

❌ **Not checking final answer**

✓ **Always verify** both sides have same number of each atom

## The Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃ Solution

**Answer**: **4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃**

**Verification**:
- Fe: 4 = 2×2 ✓
- O: 6 = 2×3 ✓

This is the smallest set of whole number coefficients that balances the equation.
