# Solving Quadratic Equations

## Standard Form

A quadratic equation must be in standard form:

**ax² + bx + c = 0**

Where:
- a is the coefficient of x² (cannot be zero)
- b is the coefficient of x
- c is the constant term

## The Quadratic Formula

For any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0:

**x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)**

The ± symbol means there are usually two solutions:
- x₁ = (-b + √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
- x₂ = (-b - √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

## Step-by-Step Application

### Example 1: 3x² + 14x - 37 = 0

This equation comes from simplifying (2x + 3)² - (x - 1)² = 45.

**Step 1**: Identify coefficients
- a = 3
- b = 14
- c = -37

**Step 2**: Calculate the discriminant

Δ = b² - 4ac
  = (14)² - 4(3)(-37)
  = 196 - (-444)
  = 196 + 444
  = 640

**Step 3**: Calculate the square root

√640 ≈ 25.30

**Step 4**: Apply the formula

x = (-14 ± 25.30) / (2 × 3)
x = (-14 ± 25.30) / 6

**Step 5**: Find both solutions

x₁ = (-14 + 25.30) / 6 = 11.30 / 6 ≈ 1.88

x₂ = (-14 - 25.30) / 6 = -39.30 / 6 ≈ -6.55

**Answer**: x ≈ 1.88 or x ≈ -6.55

## Verification

Always substitute back into the original equation to verify:

**For x ≈ 1.88**:
3(1.88)² + 14(1.88) - 37
= 3(3.53) + 26.32 - 37
= 10.59 + 26.32 - 37
≈ -0.09 ≈ 0 ✓

**For x ≈ -6.55**:
3(-6.55)² + 14(-6.55) - 37
= 3(42.90) - 91.70 - 37
= 128.70 - 91.70 - 37
≈ 0 ✓

## Example 2: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**Step 1**: Identify coefficients
- a = 1
- b = 5
- c = 6

**Step 2**: Calculate discriminant
Δ = 5² - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1

**Step 3**: Apply formula
x = (-5 ± √1) / 2
x = (-5 ± 1) / 2

**Step 4**: Two solutions
- x₁ = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2
- x₂ = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3

**Answer**: x = -2 or x = -3

## Example 3: 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0

**Step 1**: Identify coefficients
- a = 2
- b = -7
- c = 3

**Step 2**: Calculate discriminant
Δ = (-7)² - 4(2)(3) = 49 - 24 = 25

**Step 3**: Apply formula
x = (7 ± √25) / 4
x = (7 ± 5) / 4

**Step 4**: Two solutions
- x₁ = (7 + 5) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3
- x₂ = (7 - 5) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 0.5

**Answer**: x = 3 or x = 0.5

## The Discriminant Tells You:

- Δ > 0: Two distinct real solutions
- Δ = 0: One repeated solution (perfect square)
- Δ < 0: No real solutions (complex numbers)

## Common Errors to Avoid

1. **Sign of b**: Remember the formula has -b, so if b is negative, you get --b = +b
2. **Order of operations**: Calculate b² - 4ac fully before taking the square root
3. **Divide by 2a**: Both the numerator terms (not just one) are divided by 2a
4. **Two solutions**: Don't forget the ± gives you two answers!
