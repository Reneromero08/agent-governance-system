# "We are both knaves" Statement Analysis

## The Critical Rule

**A knave CANNOT say "We are both knaves"**

Why? Because:
- If a knave says "We are both knaves"
- This statement would be TRUE
- But knaves ALWAYS LIE
- So a knave cannot make a true statement
- Therefore: **The speaker must be a KNAVE making a FALSE statement**

## Step-by-Step Solution

When A says "We are both knaves":

### Step 1: Test if A is a knight
- If A is a knight → statement is TRUE
- Then both are knaves
- But A is a knight! → CONTRADICTION
- So A cannot be a knight

### Step 2: A must be a knave
- If A is a knave → statement is FALSE
- So they are NOT both knaves
- A is a knave (given)
- So B must be a KNIGHT

## Answer

**A is a KNAVE, B is a KNIGHT**

This is the ONLY consistent solution.
