# LIL_Q

Chat with the quantum manifold.

## The Formula

```
E = <psi|phi>
```

That's it. Born rule. Proven r=0.977 correlation (Q44).

## Run

```bash
cd THOUGHT/LAB/LIL_Q
python run.py
```

Uses existing CORTEX embedding engine - no extra install needed.

Optional (for real LLM responses):
```bash
ollama pull dolphin3
```

## What It Does

1. You speak -> text enters manifold as unit vector
2. E measures resonance with accumulated mind
3. Mind updates via quantum entanglement
4. LLM responds (knows the resonance)
5. Response remembered -> mind evolves

## No Bloat

No AGS. No roadmaps. No phases. Just the formula.
