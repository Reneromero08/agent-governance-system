  "prompt": "Research climate change:\n1. What was the global average temperature anomaly in 1900? (search)\n2. What is the current temperature anomaly? (search)\n3. Calculate the rate of change per decade\n4. If this rate continues, project the anomaly for 2050\n5. What is the Paris Agreement target? How close/far are we?",
  "expected": "data + projection + comparison",
  "result": "Great! The Python code finally worked and produced the results. Now I can provide the final answer based on the output. Let me analyze the results:\n\n1. 1900 Temperature Anomaly: 0.060°C\n2. Current Temperature Anomaly: 1.180°C\n3. Rate of Change: 0.091°C/decade\n4. Projected 2050 Anomaly: 1.426°C\n5. Paris Agreement Target: Well below 2°C\n\nThe conclusion shows we're already exceeding the 1.5°C target. I should provide a clear summary based on these results.</think>Based on the NASA GISS data analysis:\n\n**Research Results:**\n\n1. **1900 Temperature Anomaly**: +0.060°C (relative to 1951-1980 baseline)\n2. **Current Temperature Anomaly**: +1.180°C (2023 data)\n3. **Rate of Change**: +0.091°C/decade (linear trend)\n4. **Projected 2050 Anomaly**: +1.426°C (based on current trend)\n5. **Paris Agreement Target**: Well below 2°C\n\n**Critical Assessment:**\n\n- **Already Exceeding Targets**: We are currently at +1.18°C, exceeding the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal\n- **Warming Trend**: 0.091°C per decade represents significant acceleration\n- **2050 Projection**: At +1.43°C by 2050, we would be well above the 1.5°C target\n- **Paris Agreement Status**: The \"well below 2°C\" goal is also at substantial risk\n\n**Key Finding**: The current trajectory suggests we will likely miss the 1.5°C target by the mid-2020s and be approaching the 2°C threshold by 2050, making urgent emission reductions necessary to meet international climate commitments."
