  "expected": "golden ratio, ~1.618",
  "result": "The user provided the output from the Python script I wrote in the previous turn. The output clearly shows the computation results and the observation.\n\nThe question asked was:\n1. Compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. (Done)\n2. Compute the ratio of consecutive numbers (F(n+1)/F(n)) for the last 5 pairs. (Done)\n3. What value does this ratio approach? (Answered in the output)\n\nThe output is complete. The ratio approaches the Golden Ratio, specifically approximately 1.6180339887.\n\nI should summarize the findings clearly for the final answer.</think>Based on the computation and output provided:\n\n1.  **First 20 Fibonacci numbers:** [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]\n\n2.  **Ratios for the last 5 pairs:**\n    *   F(16)/F(15) ≈ 1.6180371353\n    *   F(17)/F(16) ≈ 1.6180327869\n    *   F(18)/F(17) ≈ 1.6180344478\n    *   F(19)/F(18) ≈ 1.6180338134\n    *   F(20)/F(19) ≈ 1.6180340557\n\n3.  **Approach Value:** The ratio approaches the **Golden Ratio**.\n    *   The value is approximately **1.6180339887**.\n    *   Mathematically, this is the positive solution to the equation $x = 1 + 1/x$, which is $(1 + \\sqrt{5}) / 2$."
