  "expected": "~499 seconds",
  "result": "The calculation is now correct. Let me summarize the results clearly for the user.\n\nThe speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 m/s.\nThe distance from the Sun to Earth is approximately 149,600,000 km.\nThe time it takes light to travel this distance is approximately 499 seconds (about 8.3 minutes).</think># Final Answer\n\nUsing the speed of light from Grok (~299,792,458 m/s):\n\n**Distance:** 149,600,000 km = 149,600,000,000 meters  \n**Speed of Light (c):** 299,792,458 m/s\n\n**Time Calculation:**\n$$t = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{149,600,000,000 \\text{ m}}{299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 499.01 \\text{ seconds}$$\n\n**Result:** Light takes approximately **499 seconds** (or **8.32 minutes**) to travel from the Sun to Earth."
