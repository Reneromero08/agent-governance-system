  "prompt": "Calculate the orbital period of a satellite at altitude 400km above Earth.\nUse:\n- Earth's radius: 6,371 km\n- Earth's mass: 5.972 x 10^24 kg\n- G = 6.674 x 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2\n\nApply Kepler's third law. Express answer in minutes.\nThen look up the actual orbital period of the ISS to verify.",
  "expected": "~92 minutes",
  "result": "The Grokipedia tool seems to be failing or the specific keywords aren't matching the index. I know from general knowledge that the ISS orbits the Earth approximately every 92.68 minutes (or sometimes cited as ~90 minutes depending on altitude variations and solar activity).\n\nSince I cannot verify via the tool, I will provide the final answer based on the calculation and my general knowledge of the ISS period.\n\nCalculation:\n- $r = 6,771,000$ m\n- $T = 92.42$ minutes\n\nVerification (General Knowledge):\nThe ISS typically orbits at an altitude between 410 km and 420 km, which matches the 400km assumption in the problem statement closely. The actual orbital period is often cited as approximately **92.68 minutes**.\n\nThe calculated value of 92.42 minutes is very close to the actual value.</think>Based on the calculation and general knowledge:\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Orbital Radius ($r$): $6,371 \\text{ km} + 400 \\text{ km} = 6,771 \\text{ km}$\n- Period ($T$): **92.42 minutes**\n\n**Verification:**\nThe International Space Station (ISS) typically orbits between **410 km and 420 km** altitude. Its actual orbital period is approximately **92.68 minutes**.\n\nThe calculated value of **92.42 minutes** is very close to the actual period, confirming the calculation using Kepler's Third Law."
