Now I need to provide the complete research on the Space Race with all the requested information:\n\n1. ✅ Fetch Sputnik 1 date: October 4, 1957\n2. ✅ Fetch Apollo 11 date: July 20, 1969  \n3. ✅ Calculate time difference: 4307 days (11 years and 292 days)\n4. Need to list 3 major milestones between these dates\n\nLet me provide the final answer with the milestones.</think>Based on my research, here's the complete Space Race timeline:\n\n**1. Sputnik 1 Launch Date:**\n- **October 4, 1957** - The first artificial satellite, launched by the Soviet Union\n\n**2. Apollo 11 Landing Date:**\n- **July 20, 1969** - The first human moon landing, achieved by NASA's Apollo 11 mission\n\n**3. Time Between Events:**\n- **4,307 days (11 years and 292 days)**\n\n**4. Major Space Race Milestones Between These Dates:**\n\n**October 1957 - May 1961:**\n- **1957**: Sputnik 1 (first satellite) and Sputnik 2 (first animal in space - Laika)\n- **1958**: Explorer 1 (first US satellite, discovery of Van Allen radiation belts)\n- **1959**: Luna 2 (first human-made object to reach the Moon's surface)\n\n**April 1961:**\n- **1961**: Vostok 1 (Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human in space)\n- **1961**: Freedom 7 (Alan Shepard becomes the first American in space)\n\n**1962:**\n- **1962**: John Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth\n\n**1963:**\n- **1963**: Valentina Tereshkova becomes the first woman in space\n\n**1965-1966:**\n- **1965**: Voskhod 2 (Alexei Leonov performs the first spacewalk)\n- **1966**: Luna 9 (first soft landing on the Moon)\n\n**1967:**\n- **1967**: Apollo 1 (tragic fire during ground tests, leading to major safety reforms)\n\n**1968-1969:**\n- **1968**: Apollo 8 (first humans to orbit the Moon)\n- **1969**: Apollo 11 (first Moon landing)"
