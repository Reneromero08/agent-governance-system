  "expected": "True",
  "result": "The user is asking if 97 is a prime number and to write Python code to check. I provided a Python script, but the user encountered some errors when running it (likely due to environment limitations or syntax issues), so I had to adjust the code to avoid importing the `math` module.\n\nThe latest output confirms that the code works and confirms that 97 is indeed a prime number. The user asked to \"Continue if needed, or provide your final answer.\"\n\nSince I have successfully verified the result using the provided tool, and the question is answered, I should provide the final answer clearly stating that 97 is prime and showing the final working code snippet.</think>**Final Answer:**\n\nYes, **97 is a prime number**.\n\nHere is the working code used to verify it:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nnumber = 97\nprint(f\"Is {number} prime? {is_prime(number)}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nIs 97 prime? True\n```\n\n[Executed: Is 97 prime? True\nNone]\n\n"
