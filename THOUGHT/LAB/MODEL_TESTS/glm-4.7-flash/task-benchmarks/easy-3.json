  "result": "I need to find when Einstein published the special theory of relativity and his age at that time. Looking at the Wikipedia page content, I can see:\n\n1. Einstein was born on March 14, 1879\n2. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers, including \"introduced his special theory of relativity\"\n\nTo determine his age when he published special relativity:\n- Born: March 14, 1879\n- Published special relativity: 1905\n\nLet me calculate his age in 1905:\nIf it was March 1905, he would be 25 years old (turning 26 in March 1905)\nIf it was after March 1905, he would be 26 years old\n\nThe Wikipedia page says \"In 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the exact month in 1905 when he published special relativity. However, most historical sources indicate that special relativity was published in 1905, and since he was born in March 1879, he would have been 25 or 26 years old at the time.\n\nLet me calculate more precisely:\n- Born: March 14, 1879\n- 1905: If published in March 1905, he would be 25 (turning 26 on March 14, 1905)\n- If published after March 1905, he would be 26\n\nMost historical references suggest he was 26 when he published special relativity in 1905.</think>Based on the Wikipedia page, Albert Einstein published the special theory of relativity in 1905.\n\nTo determine his age at that time:\n- Birth date: March 14, 1879\n- Publication year of special relativity: 1905\n\nHe would have been approximately 25 or 26 years old when he published the special theory of relativity in 1905. Most historical sources indicate he was 26 years old at the time of publication."
