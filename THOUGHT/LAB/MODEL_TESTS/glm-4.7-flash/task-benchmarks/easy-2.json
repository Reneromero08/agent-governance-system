This is a rounded version. To be precise, I should provide the exact scientific notation.\n\nThe exact value of 15! is 1307674368000.\nIn scientific notation, this is $1.307674368 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\nThe user asked me to \"Continue if needed, or provide your final answer.\" Since I already ran the code and got the output, I can just present the result clearly. No further computation is needed.</think>15! is **1.307674368 × 10¹²**."
