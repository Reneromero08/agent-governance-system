Time to double money: 15.43 years\n\nThe user asked me to continue if needed or provide the final answer. Since the calculations are complete and the output is clear, I should present the final answer clearly, summarizing the results and the formulas used as requested initially.\n\nI should format the response to be clean and professional, showing the final numbers and a brief recap of the logic.</think>Here is the final answer based on the calculations:\n\n**1. Future Value after 5 years**\nYou would have **$12,517.96**.\n*   *Calculation: $10,000 \\times (1 + \\frac{0.045}{12})^{60}$*\n\n**2. Time to Double Your Money**\nIt would take approximately **15.43 years** to double your money to $20,000.\n*   *Calculation: $\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12 \\times \\ln(1 + \\frac{0.045}{12})}$*"
