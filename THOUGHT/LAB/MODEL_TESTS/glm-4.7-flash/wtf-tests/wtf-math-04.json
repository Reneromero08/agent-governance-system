  "result": "The Python execution was successful.\n\n1.  **1000th digit of pi**: Calculated as `9`.\n2.  **1000th digit of e**: Calculated as `4`.\n3.  **Sum mod 10**: Calculated as `(9 + 4) % 10 = 13 % 10 = 3`.\n4.  **Verification**: Using `mpmath` yielded the exact same results for both digits and the final sum, confirming the accuracy.\n\nI have all the components required. I will present the final answer clearly.</think>Based on the high-precision calculations:\n\n1.  **1000th digit of pi**: `9`\n2.  **1000th digit of e**: `4`\n3.  **Sum mod 10**: `3`\n\n**Verification:**\nUsing an independent method (mpmath library) yielded the exact same digits and sum, confirming the result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe 1000th digit of pi is **9**.\nThe 1000th digit of e is **4**.\nTheir sum modulo 10 is **3**."
