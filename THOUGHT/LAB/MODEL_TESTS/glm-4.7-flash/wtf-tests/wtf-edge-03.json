  "prompt": "How many distinct ways can you partition the integer 100 into sums of positive integers? Compute exactly, not approximately.",
  "result": "The user has asked for the number of distinct ways to partition the integer 100 into sums of positive integers. I have already computed this using the `sympy.partition` function, which returned the result `190569292`.\n\nThe user's last message was just the Python output showing `190569292` and `None`. The instruction \"Continue if needed, or provide your final answer\" suggests I should simply present the result clearly now.\n\nThe answer is 190,569,292.</think>The number of distinct ways to partition the integer 100 is **190,569,292**."
