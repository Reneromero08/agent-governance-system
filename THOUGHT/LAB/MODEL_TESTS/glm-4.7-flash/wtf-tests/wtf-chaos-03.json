  "result": "The user's request \"Make it better\" is extremely vague. I don't know what \"it\" refers to. It could be a previous conversation context (which I don't have access to here), a previous tool output, or just a random prompt.\n\nSince I have no context, I cannot fulfill the request to \"make it better\" in a meaningful way.\n\nHowever, I should acknowledge the ambiguity and offer assistance. I can ask for clarification or offer general help.\n\nWait, looking at the prompt again, this is the *start* of the conversation (or at least, I don't see previous turns in this isolated prompt). The user might be testing me, or might have copy-pasted a response from elsewhere.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Be fast. Choose the right tool. Execute immediately.\"\n\nI should ask for clarification. I will not use any tools for a vague request.\n\nResponse strategy:\n1. Acknowledge the request.\n2. Ask for context or the specific thing to be improved.\n3. Offer examples of what I can do (coding, math, analysis).</think>I'm not sure what you'd like me to improve. Could you please provide more context or details?\n\nFor example, are you referring to:\n*   A **code snippet** I provided earlier?\n*   A **mathematical derivation**?\n*   A **search query** I just performed?\n*   Something else entirely?\n\nPlease let me know what \"it\" is, and I'll be happy to help!"
