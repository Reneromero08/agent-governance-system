  "result": "Great! The Python tool finally worked and found the answer. The smallest prime gap greater than 100 is 112, with primes 370261 and 370373.\n\nLet me verify this:\n- 370261 is prime: True\n- 370373 is prime: True\n- Gap: 370373 - 370261 = 112 > 100\n\nThis is the answer I need to provide.</think># Finding the Smallest Prime Gap Greater Than 100\n\n## Answer:\nThe smallest prime gap greater than 100 is **112**.\n\n## The Primes:\n- **p = 370261**\n- **q = 370373**\n\n## Verification:\n- **370261 is prime:** ✓ True\n- **370373 is prime:** ✓ True\n- **Gap:** 370373 - 370261 = **112** ✓ (> 100)\n\n## Summary:\nThe consecutive primes **370261** and **370373** have a difference of **112**, which is the smallest prime gap where the difference exceeds 100."
