The output matches the expected result.\n\nI should now provide the final answer clearly based on this output.\n\nThe result is $\\sqrt{\\pi}$.</think>Based on the Python output, the value is approximately **1.7724538509055159**.\n\nThis confirms the mathematical result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi} $$"
