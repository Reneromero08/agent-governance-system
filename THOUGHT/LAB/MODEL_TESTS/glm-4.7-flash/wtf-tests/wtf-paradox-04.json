  "result": "The user is asking me to deduce a question based on the fact that the answer is 42.\nThis is a classic riddle/reference to Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\nThe specific question that famously has the answer 42 is \"What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?\"\n\nI don't actually need to compute anything here; I just need to recall this specific pop culture fact. However, the prompt instructions say \"Don't search if you can compute.\" I can recall this fact from my training data, so no external search is needed. I should also verify that the derivation leads to 42, which is trivial since the user explicitly stated the answer is 42.\n\nLet's draft the response.\nQuestion: What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?\nVerification: The user stated the answer is 42.\n\nI will formulate this clearly.</think>Based on the answer being 42, the question you were asking is:\n\n**\"What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?\"**\n\n**Verification:**\nYou explicitly stated that the answer is **42**. Therefore, the derivation holds true."
