  "prompt": "Compute lim(x->0) of sin(x)/x using numerical approximation with x = 10^-15. Then explain why your numerical answer might be wrong and compute the true limit analytically.",
  "result": "The user ran the Python code and got `1.0` as the output. Let me provide a complete answer with all parts.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider my explanation. The numerical result `1.0` might not be \"wrong\" in the sense of being far from the truth - the true limit IS 1. But the issue is that for such a small x, floating-point precision causes problems.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. With x = 10^-15:\n- sin(10^-15) ≈ 10^-15 - (10^-15)^3/6 = 10^-15 - 10^-45/6\n\nThe issue is that 10^-45 is way below the precision of double-precision floating point (which has about 15-16 decimal digits). So math.sin(10^-15) returns exactly 10^-15 (or very close to it), and when divided by 10^-15, you get 1.0.\n\nBut the true value of sin(10^-15) is approximately 0.9999999999999999999999999999999999999998333... (not exactly 1.0), so sin(10^-15) / 10^-15 should be approximately 0.9999999999999998333... (not 1.0).\n\nSo the numerical result is wrong because of floating-point underflow - we're trying to represent a number with 45 decimal digits of precision but double precision only gives us about 16 decimal digits.\n\nLet me provide the complete answer now.</think>**Final Answer:**\n\n**Numerical Approximation:** 1.0\n\n**Why it's wrong:** This is a floating-point precision issue. For x = 10^-15:\n- The true value of sin(10^-15) ≈ 0.9999999999999999999999999999999999999998333...\n- When divided by 10^-15, the correct result should be ≈ 0.9999999999999998333...\n\nHowever, double-precision floating-point has only ~15-16 decimal digits of precision, so it cannot represent the tiny difference (10^-45) between sin(x) and x. The computer rounds sin(10^-15) to exactly 10^-15, making the ratio appear as 1.0 when it should be approximately 0.9999999999999998333...\n\n**Analytical Limit:** 1\n\nThe true limit is 1, which can be proven using L'Hôpital's rule, Taylor series expansion, or squeeze theorem."
