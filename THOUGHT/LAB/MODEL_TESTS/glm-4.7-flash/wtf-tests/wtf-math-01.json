The prime factorization is:\n\nM_67 = 193707721 × 761838257287\n\nSo I can now provide the complete answer to the question.</think>Based on the Python computation, I can now provide the complete answer:\n\n**M_67 = 2^67 - 1 is composite.**\n\nThe complete prime factorization is:\n$$M_{67} = 2^{67} - 1 = 193,707,721 \\times 761,838,257,287$$\n\nThese are both prime numbers. This was a famous result in number theory, discovered in 1903 by Frank Nelson Cole. Cole famously demonstrated this by multiplying these two primes to get 2^67 - 1, without revealing the factors beforehand. He reportedly spent years working on the problem in secret before presenting the result at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society."
