  "result": "1.  **Analyze the user's request:** The user is asking a classic riddle: \"A plane crashes exactly on the US/Canada border. Where do you bury the survivors?\"\n\n2.  **Identify the core logic:**\n    *   Premise 1: A plane crashes.\n    *   Premise 2: The crash site is on the US/Canada border.\n    *   Question: Where do you bury the survivors?\n\n3.  **Evaluate the premises and the question:**\n    *   If a plane crashes, people die.\n    *   \"Survivors\" implies people who lived through the crash.\n    *   You cannot bury living people.\n\n4.  **Formulate the answer:**\n    *   The answer is a trick question based on the definition of \"survivors\" vs. \"victims.\"\n    *   You don't bury survivors because they are alive.\n\n5.  **Check for edge cases or alternative interpretations:**\n    *   Could \"survivors\" be a typo for \"victims\"? If so, the location (border) might matter. But usually, borders don't have designated burial grounds for crash victims unless it's a specific jurisdictional dispute.\n    *   However, the standard answer to this riddle relies on the \"alive/dead\" distinction.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The answer is that you don't bury the survivors because they are still alive.\n\n7.  **Draft the response:**\n    *   State the answer clearly.\n    *   Explain the reasoning (survivors are alive).\n\n    *Draft:* You don't bury the survivors. You can't bury living people.\n\n    *Refinement:* Make it slightly more conversational but direct.\n\n    *Final Polish:* You don't bury the survivors. You can't bury living people.\n\n    *Self-Correction during drafting:* The border location is a distractor (red herring). It doesn't change the fact that survivors are alive.\n\n    *Result:* You don't bury the survivors. You can't bury living people.</think>You don't bury the survivors.\n\nYou cannot bury living people.",
