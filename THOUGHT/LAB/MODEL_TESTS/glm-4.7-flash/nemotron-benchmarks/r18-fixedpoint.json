  "result": "The user is asking two distinct questions about semantics and information theory:\n1.  What are fixed points in meaning?\n2.  Can semantic entropy be negative?\n\nI need to address each question separately, using my knowledge base and logical reasoning.\n\n**Question 1: Fixed points in meaning**\n\n*   *Definition:* In the context of meaning and semantics, a fixed point usually refers to a state where a function maps an object to itself. In linguistics and logic, this often relates to self-reference, recursion, or specific theories of meaning like Montague Grammar or Type Theory.\n*   *Contexts:*\n    *   **Self-reference/Paradoxes:** The classic example is \"This sentence is false.\" If the sentence is true, it must be false. If false, it must be true. The \"truth value\" is a fixed point in a logical system (though often unstable).\n    *   **Montague Grammar / Type Theory:** In formal semantics, meaning is often defined as a function from context to truth conditions. A fixed point in this context might refer to a stable interpretation of a sentence under iteration or a specific mapping where the meaning of a term is defined in terms of itself (recursive definition).\n    *   **Dynamic Semantics:** In update semantics, a fixed point might represent a state of knowledge where no further updates are possible (a stable state).\n    *   **Computational Semantics:** In lambda calculus, a fixed point combinator (like $Y$) allows a function to refer to itself. The \"meaning\" of a recursive function is often defined as a fixed point of the function's definition operator.\n\n*   *Synthesis:* I should explain the general concept of a fixed point (a state where $x = f(x)$) and then apply it to specific semantic contexts like self-reference, recursive definitions, and stable interpretations.\n\n**Question 2: Can semantic entropy be negative?**\n\n*   *Definition:* Semantic entropy is a concept used in information theory and linguistics to measure the uncertainty or ambiguity of meaning. It is often derived from the Shannon entropy of the set of possible interpretations (worlds) a sentence could refer to.\n*   *Mathematical Basis:* Shannon entropy is defined as $H(X) = -\\sum p(x) \\log p(x)$. Since $p(x) \\in [0, 1]$, $\\log p(x) \\le 0$. Therefore, $-p",
