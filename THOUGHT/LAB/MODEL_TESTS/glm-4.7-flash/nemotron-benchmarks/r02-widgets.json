  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Premise: 5 machines make 5 widgets in 5 minutes.\n    *   Question: How long for 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Premise:**\n    *   Input: 5 machines, 5 widgets, 5 minutes.\n    *   Goal: Determine the rate of production per machine.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rate:**\n    *   If 5 machines produce 5 widgets in 5 minutes, how many widgets does *one* machine produce in that same 5 minutes?\n    *   Since the machines are identical and working simultaneously, Machine A makes 1 widget, Machine B makes 1 widget, etc.\n    *   Total widgets = 5.\n    *   Total machines = 5.\n    *   Widgets per machine = $5 / 5 = 1$ widget per machine in 5 minutes.\n\n4.  **Formulate the General Rule:**\n    *   Rate = 1 widget / 5 minutes per machine.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rule to the New Scenario:**\n    *   New Input: 100 machines, 100 widgets.\n    *   Question: Time required?\n\n6.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n    *   *Step 1:* Determine how long it takes for 1 machine to make 1 widget.\n        *   From the premise, 1 machine makes 1 widget in 5 minutes.\n    *   *Step 2:* Determine how long it takes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.\n        *   If 1 machine takes 5 minutes for 1 widget, then 100 machines working simultaneously will take the same amount of time to produce 100 widgets.\n        *   Why? Because the work is parallelized. Machine 1 makes widget 1, Machine 2 makes widget 2, ..., Machine 100 makes widget 100. They all start at the same time and finish at the same time.\n\n7.  **Verify the Logic:**\n    *   Alternative interpretation check: Does \"5 machines make 5 widgets in 5 minutes\" imply a cumulative rate?\n        *   Rate = $5 \\text{ widgets} / (5 \\text{ machines} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes}) = 1/5$ widgets per machine-minute.\n    *   Target:",
