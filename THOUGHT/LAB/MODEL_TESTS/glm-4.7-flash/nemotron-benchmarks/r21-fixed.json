  "result": "1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    *   There are 100 people.\n    *   Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100.\n    *   The assignment is \"random\". This implies a permutation of the numbers 1 to 100.\n    *   I need to find the expected number of people who get their *own* number (i.e., fixed points in the permutation).\n\n2.  **Define the Random Variable:**\n    *   Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of people who get their own number.\n    *   $X$ can take values $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 100$.\n\n3.  **Define Indicator Variables:**\n    *   It's often easier to calculate expectations using indicator variables.\n    *   Let $X_i$ be the indicator variable for person $i$ getting their own number.\n    *   $X_i = 1$ if person $i$ gets number $i$.\n    *   $X_i = 0$ if person $i$ does *not* get number $i$.\n    *   The total number of people who get their own number is $X = X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_{100}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation of an Indicator Variable:**\n    *   The expected value of an indicator variable is simply the probability that the event occurs.\n    *   $E[X_i] = P(\\text{person } i \\text{ gets number } i)$.\n    *   Since the assignment is a random permutation of 100 distinct numbers, the probability that person $i$ gets number $i$ is $\\frac{1}{100}$.\n\n5.  **Use Linearity of Expectation:**\n    *   The expectation of the sum is the sum of the expectations.\n    *   $E[X] = E[X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_{100}] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + \\dots + E[X_{100}]$.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   $E[X] = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{100}}_{100 \\text{ times}}$\n    *   $E[X] =",
