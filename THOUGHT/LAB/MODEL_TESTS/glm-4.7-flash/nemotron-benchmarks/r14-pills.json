  "prompt": "You need to take 1 pill every 30 minutes. You have 3 pills. How long do they last?",
  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Action:** Take 1 pill every 30 minutes.\n    *   **Resource:** 3 pills.\n    *   **Question:** How long do they last?\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Logic:**\n    *   The duration is determined by the frequency of consumption and the total number of pills.\n    *   Formula: Total Duration = (Number of Pills - 1) * Interval\n    *   *Why - 1?* Because the first pill starts the clock. The second pill starts the next 30-minute block. The third pill starts the block after that. The last pill doesn't need a follow-up pill to finish the cycle.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Determine the interval. The prompt says \"every 30 minutes\".\n    *   **Step 2:** Determine the number of intervals. With 3 pills, there are 2 intervals.\n        *   Pill 1 at Time 0.\n        *   Pill 2 at Time 30 mins.\n        *   Pill 3 at Time 60 mins.\n    *   **Step 3:** Calculate total time.\n        *   Time = 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes.\n\n4.  **Verify the Logic:**\n    *   *Alternative interpretation:* Does \"every 30 minutes\" mean the *last* pill is taken at the end of the 30-minute period? No, standard interpretation is the start of the period.\n    *   *Edge case:* What if the user takes the first pill immediately? Yes, that's the standard assumption.\n    *   *Result:* 60 minutes.\n\n5.  **Draft the Response:**\n    *   State the answer clearly.\n    *   Explain the reasoning (the \"minus one\" rule).\n    *   Show the timeline.\n\n6.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   Answer: 60 minutes (1 hour).\n    *   Explanation:\n        *   Pill 1 starts the cycle.\n        *   Pill 2 is taken 30 minutes later.\n        *   Pill 3 is taken 30 minutes after that.\n        *   The cycle ends after the third pill is taken.\n\n7.  **Output Generation:** (Proceed to generate the response based on the above steps).</think>They last **60 minutes** (or 1",
