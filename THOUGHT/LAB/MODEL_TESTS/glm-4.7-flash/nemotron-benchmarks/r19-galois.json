  "prompt": "Why is the quintic equation unsolvable by radicals? Use Galois theory.",
  "result": "The user is asking for a proof or explanation of why the quintic equation is unsolvable by radicals, specifically using Galois theory.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Request:**\n*   **Topic:** Quintic equations (degree 5 polynomials).\n*   **Core Question:** Why are they unsolvable by radicals?\n*   **Method:** Galois theory.\n*   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n\n**2. Identify Key Concepts:**\n*   **Field Extensions:** $K/F$.\n*   **Algebraic Elements:** Roots of polynomials.\n*   **Splitting Field:** The smallest field containing all roots of a polynomial.\n*   **Galois Group:** The group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field.\n*   **Radical Extensions:** Field extensions obtained by adjoining roots (e.g., $\\sqrt[n]{a}$).\n*   **Solvable Groups:** Groups that have a chain of normal subgroups where the quotients are cyclic.\n*   **Abelian Groups:** A special case of solvable groups (commutative).\n*   **The Theorem:** A polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group.\n\n**3. Structure the Explanation:**\n*   **Introduction:** Define the problem (finding roots of $ax^5 + bx^4 + \\dots = 0$) and the goal (expressing roots using +, -, *, /, and radicals).\n*   **Galois Theory Connection:** Introduce the fundamental theorem: Solvability by radicals $\\iff$ Solvable Galois group.\n*   **Step 1: Radical Extensions:**\n    *   Explain what a radical extension is.\n    *   Explain that if a polynomial is solvable by radicals, its splitting field is built by a tower of radical extensions.\n*   **Step 2: Solvable Groups:**\n    *   Define a solvable group (existence of a chain of normal subgroups with cyclic quotients).\n    *   Connect this to the structure of radical extensions. If you have a tower of cyclic extensions, the Galois group is solvable.\n*   **Step 3: The Quintic Counterexample (The Symmetric Group $S_5$):**\n    *   Introduce the general quintic polynomial $x^5 + ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e$.\n   ",
