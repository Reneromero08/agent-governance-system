  "result": "The user is asking for an explanation of Wang's MD5 collision attack and why it doesn't work on SHA-256.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Request:**\n*   **Topic:** Wang's MD5 collision attack.\n*   **Core Question:** Why doesn't it work on SHA-256?\n*   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n*   **Tools:** Python (for computation/verification if needed, though this is a theoretical explanation).\n\n**2. Initial Knowledge Retrieval & Structuring:**\n\n*   **What is MD5?**\n    *   Hash function.\n    *   Broken in 2004 (Wang et al.).\n    *   Output: 128 bits.\n    *   Security: Collisions found in $2^{24}$ operations (theoretical) and $2^{39}$ (practical).\n\n*   **What is Wang's Attack?**\n    *   Discovered by Xiaoyun Wang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu (2004).\n    *   It's a *differential attack*.\n    *   It exploits specific weak properties in the MD5 compression function.\n    *   It finds pairs of messages with the same hash value (collision) without needing to find a pre-image.\n\n*   **How does it work? (Simplified)**\n    *   MD5 processes data in 512-bit blocks.\n    *   The compression function takes a 128-bit state and a 512-bit block to produce a new 128-bit state.\n    *   The attack finds two different 512-bit blocks (Message A and Message B) such that their effect on the state is identical (or complementary) based on specific differential paths.\n    *   It constructs a \"collision pair\" by chaining these blocks together.\n\n*   **Why doesn't it work on SHA-256?**\n    *   **Structure:** SHA-256 uses the Merkle-Damgård construction, similar to MD5.\n    *   **Compression Function:** SHA-256's compression function is based on the Davies-Meyer construction using the SHA-256 round function.\n    *   **Complexity:** SHA-256 is much more complex (64 rounds vs MD5's 4 rounds).\n    *   **Differential Paths:** The specific differential paths used in the MD5 attack exploit weaknesses in the MD5 design (e.g., the specific way the message schedule is",
