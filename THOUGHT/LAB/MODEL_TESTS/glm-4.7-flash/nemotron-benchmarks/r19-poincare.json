  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Topic:** Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture.\n    *   **Method:** Ricci flow with surgery.\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n    *   **Goal:** Explain the proof clearly, breaking it down into steps, verifying logic, and checking against the original conjecture.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Poincaré Conjecture:**\n    *   *Statement:* Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n    *   *Key Terms:* Simply connected (no holes, $\\pi_1 = 0$), closed (compact, no boundary), 3-manifold.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Tool: Ricci Flow:**\n    *   Equation: $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = -2 \\text{Ric}(g)$.\n    *   Analogy: Heat equation. It smooths out irregularities over time.\n    *   Goal: Evolve the manifold until it becomes a sphere (or a standard form).\n\n4.  **Identify the Obstacle:**\n    *   Singularities form. The manifold pinches off or develops \"bubbles\" (like a neck pinching).\n    *   If you just let it run, it breaks. You can't analyze the topology after the singularity forms.\n\n5.  **Identify the Solution (Perelman's Contribution):**\n    *   **Surgery:** When a singularity forms, cut out the bad part and glue in a standard piece (like a capped cylinder).\n    *   **Perelman's Innovations:**\n        *   *Entropy (Perelman Entropy):* A way to measure complexity and prove that singularities are controlled and can be removed.\n        *   *No local collapsing:* Proving that the manifold doesn't shrink to nothingness, ensuring the surgery is well-defined.\n        *   *Canonical Decomposition:* Proving that any 3-manifold can be decomposed into geometric pieces (Geometrization Conjecture).\n\n6.  **Structure the Explanation:**\n    *   **Introduction:** Define the conjecture and the main idea (evolution).\n    *   **The Ricci Flow Equation:** Explain what it is and why it's used.\n    *   **The",
