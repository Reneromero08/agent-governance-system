  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Problem: A classic riddle/math problem.\n    *   Given:\n        *   Total cost = $1.10\n        *   Bat costs $1.00 *more* than the Ball.\n    *   Goal: Find the cost of the Ball.\n\n2.  **Formulate Equations:**\n    *   Let $B$ be the cost of the Ball.\n    *   Let $X$ be the cost of the Bat.\n    *   Equation 1 (Total cost): $B + X = 1.10$\n    *   Equation 2 (Difference): $X = B + 1.00$\n\n3.  **Solve the System:**\n    *   Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:\n        $B + (B + 1.00) = 1.10$\n    *   Combine like terms:\n        $2B + 1.00 = 1.10$\n    *   Isolate $B$:\n        $2B = 1.10 - 1.00$\n        $2B = 0.10$\n    *   Solve for $B$:\n        $B = 0.10 / 2$\n        $B = 0.05$\n\n4.  **Verify the Answer:**\n    *   If the Ball costs $0.05, then the Bat costs $1.05.\n    *   Check Total: $0.05 + 1.05 = 1.10$. (Correct)\n    *   Check Difference: $1.05 - 0.05 = 1.00$. (Correct)\n\n5.  **Address the Common Trap:**\n    *   The intuitive answer is often $0.10 (because $1.10 - $1.00 = $0.10).\n    *   I need to explain *why* this is wrong to demonstrate the reasoning process.\n    *   If the ball were $0.10, the bat would be $1.10. The total would be $1.20, not $1.10.\n\n6.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   State the variables.\n    *   Show the algebra.\n    *   State the final answer clearly.\n    *   Add the verification step.\n\n7.  **Refinement:**\n    *   The user asked for a specific reasoning",
