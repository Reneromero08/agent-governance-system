  "result": "The user wants a proof of the Cook-Levin theorem, which establishes that the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is NP-complete.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to prove that SAT $\\in$ NP and that SAT is NP-hard. If SAT is in NP and NP-hard, then it is NP-complete.\n\n**2. Structure of the Proof:**\nThe standard proof of the Cook-Levin theorem follows these steps:\n*   **Step 1: Show SAT $\\in$ NP.**\n    *   Definition of NP: Verifiable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine (or equivalently, a deterministic Turing machine with a polynomial time verifier).\n    *   Given a formula $\\phi$ and an assignment $A$, check if $A$ satisfies $\\phi$. This takes time proportional to the number of variables, which is polynomial in the size of $\\phi$.\n*   **Step 2: Define the Turing Machine Model.**\n    *   We need a standard model to encode the computation. A deterministic Turing machine (DTM) is the standard choice.\n*   **Step 3: Define the Computation Table.**\n    *   The computation of a DTM on input $x$ can be represented as a table of cells.\n    *   Rows represent time steps $t = 0, 1, \\dots, T$.\n    *   Columns represent tape cells $i = 1, \\dots, T'$.\n    *   Each cell contains a symbol from the tape alphabet $\\Gamma$ or the state symbol $q$.\n*   **Step 4: Define the Boolean Formula $\\phi$.**\n    *   Construct a formula $\\phi$ that is satisfiable iff the computation table is valid.\n    *   $\\phi$ will be a conjunction of clauses.\n*   **Step 5: Constructing the Clauses.**\n    *   We need clauses to enforce the validity of the table.\n    *   **Constraint 1: Initial State.** At time 0, the machine is in the start state $q_0$ and the tape contains the input $x$.\n    *   **Constraint 2: Valid Transitions.** For every cell $(t, i)$, the content must be consistent with the transition function $\\delta$. If the machine is in state $q$ and reads symbol $a$, it must write $b$, move $",
