  "result": "The user wants to measure exactly 15 minutes using two hourglasses: one that takes 7 minutes to run and one that takes 11 minutes to run.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nI need to find a sequence of flipping the hourglasses that results in a total elapsed time of exactly 15 minutes.\n\n**2. Analyze the Tools:**\n- Hourglass A: 7 minutes\n- Hourglass B: 11 minutes\n\n**3. Strategy:**\nI need to use the differences between the times or the sums of the times to reach 15.\nPossible combinations:\n- $11 + 7 = 18$ (Too much)\n- $11 - 7 = 4$ (Not 15)\n- $7 + 7 = 14$ (Close, but not 15)\n- $11 - 4 = 7$ (Not helpful)\n- $15 = 11 + 7 - 3$ (Where does 3 come from?)\n- $15 = 7 + 7 + 1$ (Where does 1 come from?)\n\nLet's look at the difference method again.\n$11 - 7 = 4$.\nIf I can measure 4 minutes, I can add it to 11.\nHow to measure 4 minutes?\n$7 - 3 = 4$.\nHow to measure 3 minutes?\n$11 - 7 = 4$. No.\n$7 + 7 = 14$. $14 - 11 = 3$.\nSo, if I can measure 14 minutes, I can subtract 11 to get 3.\nIf I have 3 minutes, I can subtract it from 7 to get 4.\nIf I have 4 minutes, I can add it to 11 to get 15.\n\nLet's trace this path:\n1. Start both hourglasses (7 and 11).\n2. When the 7-minute runs out, flip it immediately. (Time elapsed: 7).\n3. When the 11-minute runs out, flip it immediately. (Time elapsed: 11).\n4. When the 7-minute runs out again, flip it immediately. (Time elapsed: 11 + 7 = 18).\n5. At this point, the 11-minute has been running for $18 - 11 = 7$ minutes. It has 4 minutes left.\n6.
