  "result": "1.  **Analyze the User's Question:**\n    *   The user is asking a classic philosophical paradox: \"What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?\"\n    *   This is a question about logic, physics, and philosophy, not a request for code or a specific mathematical calculation (though I can use Python to simulate concepts if needed, but here it's more about conceptual analysis).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Conflict:**\n    *   The premise contains two contradictory concepts:\n        *   An \"unstoppable force\" (infinite acceleration/mass or a force that cannot be resisted).\n        *   An \"immovable object\" (infinite mass/inertia or an object that cannot be moved).\n    *   In classical physics, these two concepts are mutually exclusive. You cannot have both in the same universe simultaneously because they violate the laws of conservation of momentum and energy.\n\n3.  **Determine the Nature of the Question:**\n    *   Is it a riddle? Yes.\n    *   Is it a physics question? Yes.\n    *   Is it a philosophical question? Yes.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Answer Strategy:**\n    *   **Direct Answer:** State clearly that this is a paradox.\n    *   **Logical Analysis:** Explain *why* it's a paradox (mutually exclusive concepts).\n    *   **Physics Perspective:** Explain how this relates to Newtonian mechanics (conservation of momentum).\n    *   **Philosophical Perspectives:**\n        *   *The Riddle Answer:* \"They cancel each other out\" or \"Nothing happens\" (often considered the \"smart\" answer).\n        *   *The Linguistic Answer:* The definitions are flawed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize that the question is flawed because it assumes the existence of mutually exclusive entities.\n\n5.  **Drafting the Response (Iterative refinement):**\n\n    *   *Draft 1 (Internal Monologue):* It's a paradox. If something is unstoppable, it can't be stopped. If something is immovable, it can't be moved. If they meet, it breaks physics. So, the answer is that the question is impossible.\n\n    *   *Draft 2 (More formal):* This is a classic philosophical paradox. In logic, these two concepts are mutually exclusive. If an unstoppable force exists, an immovable object cannot exist, and vice versa. Therefore,",
