  "prompt": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?",
  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking for the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow. This is a famous question from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source:** The question is a reference to the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (1975).\n\n3.  **Recall the Context:**\n    *   King Arthur and Sir Bedevere are discussing swallows.\n    *   Arthur asks: \"What do you mean? An African or a European swallow?\"\n    *   Bedevere replies: \"Huh? I don't know that... Aaaah!\"\n\n4.  **Determine the Answer:** The movie *does not* provide a scientific answer. It is a joke about the absurdity of the quest for the Holy Grail.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Response:**\n    *   Acknowledge the reference.\n    *   State that the movie doesn't actually say.\n    *   Provide the canonical joke answer (the African vs. European distinction).\n    *   (Optional but fun) Mention the \"Monty Python\" nature of the question.\n\n6.  **Refine the Response:**\n    *   Start with the direct answer: The movie doesn't say.\n    *   Quote the specific exchange.\n    *   Explain *why* it's funny (the absurdity).\n\n7.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   \"According to *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, the answer is not provided.\"\n    *   \"The joke relies on the distinction between an African swallow and a European swallow.\"\n    *   \"Arthur asks: 'What do you mean? An African or a European swallow?'\"\n    *   \"Bedevere replies: 'Huh? I don't know that... Aaaah!'\"\n\n8.  **Check against constraints:** The user asked for reasoning. I should briefly explain *why* I can't calculate it (it's a fictional scenario) and then provide the pop-culture answer.\n\n    *   *Step 1:* Identify the question as a pop-culture reference.\n    *   *Step 2:* Recall the specific scene.\n    *   *Step 3:* Conclude that the movie leaves it ambiguous.\n\n    *Self-Correction:* Should I look up the actual physics of swallow flight?\n    *   *Decision:* No, the",
