  "result": "The user wants me to solve the classic \"12 balls, one odd weight\" puzzle.\n\n**Goal:** Identify the odd ball and determine if it's heavier or lighter using a balance scale exactly 3 times.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- 12 balls.\n- 1 is odd (heavier or lighter).\n- 3 weighings.\n- Balance scale (3 outcomes: Left Heavy, Right Heavy, Equal).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to break this down systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Setup**\n- Label the balls 1 through 12.\n\n**Step 2: First Weighing**\nI need to divide the balls into groups to maximize information gain.\n- Group A: 4 balls (1, 2, 3, 4)\n- Group B: 4 balls (5, 6, 7, 8)\n- Group C: 4 balls (9, 10, 11, 12)\n\n**Scenario 1: First Weighing is Balanced (1,2,3,4 vs 5,6,7,8)**\n- If balanced, the odd ball is in Group C (9, 10, 11, 12).\n- The balls 1-8 are \"normal\".\n- I have 2 weighings left to find the odd ball among 4 and determine heavy/light.\n\n**Scenario 2: First Weighing is Unbalanced (e.g., Left Heavy)**\n- Assume (1,2,3,4) > (5,6,7,8).\n- This means either one of {1,2,3,4} is Heavy, or one of {5,6,7,8} is Light.\n- Balls {9,10,11,12} are normal.\n- I have 2 weighings left to find the odd ball among 8 suspects.\n\n**Step 3: Detailed Analysis of Scenarios**\n\n**Case A: First Weighing Balanced (1,2,3,4 = 5,6,7,8)**\n- Odd ball is in {9, 10, 11, 12}.\n- Weighing 2: Compare {9, 10, 11} vs {1, 2, 3} (known normals).\n    - If balanced: Odd ball is 12.\n        - Weighing 3: Compare 12 vs 1.\n            -",
