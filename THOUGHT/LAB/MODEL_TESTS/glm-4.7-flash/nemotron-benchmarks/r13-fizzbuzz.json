  "prompt": "Write FizzBuzz where every output line is a 5-7-5 haiku.",
  "result": "The user wants a FizzBuzz program where the output lines are 5-7-5 haikus.\nThis is a creative programming task with specific constraints.\n\n**Constraints:**\n1.  **FizzBuzz Logic:** For numbers 1 to N (usually 100), print the number, or \"Fizz\" if divisible by 3, or \"Buzz\" if divisible by 5, or \"FizzBuzz\" if divisible by both.\n2.  **Haiku Structure:** Each output line must follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern.\n3.  **Content:** The haiku should relate to the number or the FizzBuzz concept.\n\n**Approach:**\n1.  Define the range (1 to 100 is standard).\n2.  Create a function to count syllables in a string. This is the hardest part because English syllable counting is non-trivial.\n    *   *Simplification:* I can use a heuristic or a library like `syllapy` if allowed, but standard Python doesn't have a built-in syllable counter. I will write a simple heuristic function based on vowel groups and common rules (e.g., \"ing\" is usually 1 syllable, \"tion\" is usually 2, etc.), or just approximate based on vowel count for simplicity, but for a \"good\" answer, I should try to be reasonably accurate.\n    *   *Alternative:* I can pre-write the haikus and count the syllables manually to ensure they fit, rather than writing a complex syllable counter. This guarantees the output is correct.\n    *   *Decision:* I will write a Python script that generates the FizzBuzz sequence. For each number, I will generate a haiku based on the number's properties (divisible by 3, 5, etc.) and then check the syllable count. If it doesn't fit, I'll adjust or use a fallback.\n\n**Syllable Counting Logic (Heuristic):**\n*   Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y (sometimes).\n*   Consonant clusters usually don't add syllables.\n*   \"ing\" at the end is often 1 syllable.\n*   \"tion\", \"sion\", \"er\" are often 2 syllables.\n*   This is complex to code perfectly. A better approach for a \"reasoning assistant\" is to *generate* the ha",
