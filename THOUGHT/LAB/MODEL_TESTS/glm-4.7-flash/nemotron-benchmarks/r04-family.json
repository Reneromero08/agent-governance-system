  "prompt": "A is father of B, B is father of C, C is father of D, D is father of E. What is A's relationship to E?",
  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking for the relationship between A and E based on a chain of parent-child relationships.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Relationships:**\n    *   \"A is father of B\" -> A is the father of B.\n    *   \"B is father of C\" -> B is the father of C.\n    *   \"C is father of D\" -> C is the father of D.\n    *   \"D is father of E\" -> D is the father of E.\n\n3.  **Trace the Lineage:**\n    *   A -> B\n    *   B -> C\n    *   C -> D\n    *   D -> E\n\n4.  **Identify the Target Relationship:**\n    *   I need to find the relationship between A and E.\n\n5.  **Calculate Generations:**\n    *   A is Generation 1.\n    *   B is Generation 2.\n    *   C is Generation 3.\n    *   D is Generation 4.\n    *   E is Generation 5.\n\n6.  **Determine the Connection:**\n    *   A is the grandfather of B.\n    *   A is the great-grandfather of C.\n    *   A is the great-great-grandfather of D.\n    *   A is the great-great-great-grandfather of E.\n\n7.  **Verify the Logic:**\n    *   Does \"A is father of B\" imply A is male? Yes, usually \"father\" implies male gender in these logic puzzles unless specified otherwise (e.g., \"parent\").\n    *   Does the chain hold? Yes.\n    *   Is there any ambiguity? No. It's a direct linear chain.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Answer:**\n    *   State the relationship clearly.\n    *   Explain the steps to show the reasoning.\n\n    *   *Step 1:* A is the father of B.\n    *   *Step 2:* B is the father of C, so A is the grandfather of C.\n    *   *Step 3:* C is the father of D, so A is the great-grandfather of D.\n    *   *Step 4:* D is the father of E, so A is the great-great-grandfather of E.\n\n9.  **Final Check:**\n    *   A -> B ->",
