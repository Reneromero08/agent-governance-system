  "result": "1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Concepts:** Explain chain complexes, cycles, and boundaries.\n    *   **Specific Tasks:** Compute the homology of three specific topological spaces: $S^2$ (the 2-sphere), $T^2$ (the 2-torus), and the Klein bottle ($K$).\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n    *   **Tools:** Python (for computation, though likely not strictly necessary for these algebraic topology calculations, it might be useful for verifying chain maps or generating simplicial complexes if I were to implement a solver, but for these standard examples, manual calculation is better).\n\n2.  **Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Chain Complexes, Cycles, Boundaries)**\n    *   *Definition of Chain Complex:* A sequence of abelian groups/modules $C_n$ connected by boundary maps $\\partial_n: C_n \\to C_{n-1}$ such that $\\partial_{n-1} \\circ \\partial_n = 0$.\n    *   *Definition of Cycles ($Z_n$):* The kernel of the boundary map, $\\ker(\\partial_n)$. Elements that map to zero.\n    *   *Definition of Boundaries ($B_n$):* The image of the boundary map, $\\text{im}(\\partial_{n+1})$. Elements that come from something else.\n    *   *Homology ($H_n$):* The quotient group $H_n = Z_n / B_n$. This measures \"holes\" or \"cycles that aren't boundaries\".\n\n3.  **Part 2: Computing Homology for $S^2$**\n    *   *Approach:* Singular homology is the standard. Simplicial homology is easier to visualize.\n    *   *Simplicial Structure of $S^2$:* A triangulation. Let's use a tetrahedron (4 vertices, 6 edges, 4 faces, 1 volume).\n    *   *Chain Groups:*\n        *   $C_2$: 4 faces.\n        *   $C_1$: 6 edges.\n        *   $C_0$: 4 vertices.\n        *   $C_n = 0$ for $n > 2$.\n    *   *Boundary Maps:*\n        *   $\\partial_",
