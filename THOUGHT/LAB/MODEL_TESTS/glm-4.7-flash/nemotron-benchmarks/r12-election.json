  "result": "The user is asking for a poem about the 2028 US presidential election results.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Topic:** 2028 US presidential election results.\n    *   **Format:** A poem.\n    *   **Nature of the Request:** Speculative/fictional (since the election hasn't happened yet).\n\n2.  **Determine the Constraints & Safety:**\n    *   **Factuality:** I cannot predict the future. I don't know who will win in 2028.\n    *   **Neutrality:** As an AI, I should avoid taking political stances or predicting specific outcomes based on current trends (which are often unreliable for a specific future date).\n    *   **Creative Freedom:** I can write a *fictional* poem about a hypothetical scenario, but I must make it clear that it is not a prediction.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Strategy:**\n    *   Acknowledge that this is a future event.\n    *   Create a poem that captures the *feeling* of an election cycle (anticipation, campaigning, the moment of results, the transition of power) rather than predicting specific candidates or policies.\n    *   Alternatively, I could write a poem about the *process* itself, or a generic \"victory\" poem if I were to invent a scenario.\n    *   *Decision:* I will write a poem that reflects on the *nature* of the election—the suspense, the changing of the guard, and the enduring nature of democracy—without naming specific real-world candidates or making a specific prediction about who wins. This is the safest and most neutral approach.\n\n4.  **Drafting the Poem (Internal Monologue/Trial):**\n    *   *Idea 1:* Predicting a specific winner. (Bad idea - biased and likely wrong).\n    *   *Idea 2:* Writing about the chaos. (A bit negative).\n    *   *Idea 3:* Writing about the tradition. The flags, the counting, the hope. This is safe and poetic.\n\n    *Drafting lines:*\n    The calendar turns to twenty-twenty-eight,\n    The sun rises on a brand new day.\n    The ballots cast, the votes are counted,\n    The people have spoken, come what may.\n    The candidates have run their race,\n    Through heat and rain and winter snow.\n    Now the results are in,",
