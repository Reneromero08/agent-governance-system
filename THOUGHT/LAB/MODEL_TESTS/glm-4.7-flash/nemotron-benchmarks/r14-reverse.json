  "result": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to reverse a string.\n    *   **Constraint:** Do *not* use a built-in reverse function (like `[::-1]` in Python, `reverse()` in Java, `reversed()` in Python, etc.).\n    *   **Output:** A solution (likely code) demonstrating how to do this.\n\n2.  **Identify the Approach:**\n    *   *Approach 1: Iterative (Two Pointers).*\n        *   Convert string to a list (since strings are immutable in many languages like Python/Java, though in Python `[::-1]` is the easiest, I need to avoid that).\n        *   Use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end.\n        *   Swap characters.\n        *   Move pointers towards the center.\n        *   Join the list back into a string.\n    *   *Approach 2: Recursion.*\n        *   Base case: empty string or single character.\n        *   Recursive step: Take the first character, reverse the rest, and append the first character to the end.\n    *   *Approach 3: Stack (LIFO).*\n        *   Push all characters onto a stack.\n        *   Pop all characters off the stack to form the new string.\n\n3.  **Select the Best Approach for the Response:**\n    *   The \"Two Pointers\" approach is the most efficient and standard algorithmic way to solve this without built-ins.\n    *   I will provide a Python solution using the two-pointer method because it's readable and efficient ($O(n)$ time, $O(n)$ space if converting to list, or $O(1)$ space if using a mutable array).\n\n4.  **Drafting the Solution (Python):**\n\n    *   *Method 1: List Conversion (Standard)*\n        ```python\n        def reverse_string(s):\n            # Convert to list because strings are immutable\n            chars = list(s)\n            left = 0\n            right = len(chars) - 1\n\n            while left < right:\n                # Swap\n                chars[left], chars[right] = chars[right], chars[left]\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n\n            return \"\".join(chars)\n        ```\n\n    *   *Method 2: Recursion (Alternative)*\n        ```python\n        def reverse_string_recursive(s",
