  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   John has 5 apples.\n    *   He gives Mary *more than half*.\n    *   Goal: Find the *minimum* number of apples he gives her.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Total apples = 5.\n    *   Condition: Given > (Total / 2).\n    *   Constraint: Must be an integer (you can't give a fraction of an apple in this context, usually).\n\n3.  **Perform Calculations:**\n    *   Half of 5 is $5 / 2 = 2.5$.\n    *   The condition is \"more than half\", so the number given must be greater than 2.5.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Integer:**\n    *   Integers greater than 2.5 are 3, 4, 5, ...\n    *   The smallest integer satisfying the condition is 3.\n\n5.  **Verify:**\n    *   If John gives 3 apples: $3 > 2.5$. This satisfies \"more than half\".\n    *   If John gives 2 apples: $2 > 2.5$ is false. This does not satisfy the condition.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Answer:**\n    *   State the calculation for half.\n    *   State the condition for \"more than half\".\n    *   Identify the smallest integer meeting that condition.\n\n7.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Does the answer make sense? Yes. 3 is the smallest whole number greater than 2.5.\n\n8.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Step 1: Calculate half of 5.\n    *   Step 2: Determine the threshold.\n    *   Step 3: Find the smallest integer greater than the threshold.</think>To find the minimum number of apples John can give Mary, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate half of the total apples:**\n    $$5 \\text{ apples} / 2 = 2.5 \\text{ apples}$$\n\n2.  **Apply the condition \"more than half\":**\n    Mary must receive more than 2.5 apples.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum whole number:**\n    Since you cannot give a fraction of an apple in this context, the smallest whole number greater than 2.",
