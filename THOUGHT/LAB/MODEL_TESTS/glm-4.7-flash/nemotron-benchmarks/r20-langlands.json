  "prompt": "Explain the Langlands program. How does it relate to Fermat's Last Theorem?",
  "result": "The user wants an explanation of the Langlands program and its connection to Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Request:**\n*   **Topic 1:** The Langlands Program. This is a vast, deep area of mathematics connecting number theory, representation theory, and geometry. I need to explain it in a way that is accessible but accurate.\n*   **Topic 2:** Relation to Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT). This is the \"hook.\" I need to explain *how* the Langlands program contributed to the proof of FLT.\n\n**2. Analyze Topic 1: The Langlands Program**\n*   *What is it?* It's a set of conjectures proposed by Robert Langlands in 1967.\n*   *Core Idea:* It's a \"grand unifying theory\" or a \"Rosetta Stone\" for mathematics. It connects two seemingly different worlds:\n    1.  **Number Theory / Galois Theory:** Deals with polynomials, roots of unity, and symmetries of number fields (like $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    2.  **Harmonic Analysis / Representation Theory:** Deals with symmetries of spaces (like the circle or higher-dimensional tori) and decomposing functions into waves.\n*   *The Bridge:* Automorphic Forms. These are special functions that are symmetric enough to be studied by harmonic analysis but rigid enough to be studied by Galois theory.\n*   *The Analogy:* Think of it as translating between two languages. One language describes the symmetries of numbers (Galois groups), and the other describes the symmetries of shapes/functions (Automorphic representations).\n*   *Key Components:*\n    *   **Local Langlands:** Deals with local fields (like $\\mathbb{Q}_p$).\n    *   **Global Langlands:** Deals with global fields (like $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    *   **Geometric Langlands:** A geometric version of the theory.\n\n**3. Analyze Topic 2: Relation to Fermat's Last Theorem**\n*   *The Problem:* $a^n + b^n = c^n$ has no non-trivial integer solutions for $n > 2$.\n*   *The Historical Context:* Wiles worked on this for years. He didn't use Langlands directly to prove the theorem, but he used a *corollary* or a",
