  "result": "1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Goal 1:** Derive the Schwarzschild radius ($r_s = 2GM/c^2$) using the concept of escape velocity.\n    *   **Goal 2:** Explain what happens to time at the event horizon.\n    *   **Constraints:** Use the provided reasoning approach (break down steps, verify, check final answer). Use Python for computation if needed.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct Goal 1: Deriving $r_s$ from Escape Velocity:**\n    *   *Concept:* Escape velocity ($v_e$) is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape a massive body's gravitational pull without further propulsion.\n    *   *Formula:* The standard Newtonian formula for escape velocity is $v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$.\n    *   *Connection to General Relativity (GR):* The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. In Newtonian physics, the \"surface\" of a black hole is often approximated by the radius where escape velocity equals the speed of light ($c$).\n    *   *Step-by-Step Derivation:*\n        1.  Start with Newtonian escape velocity: $v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$.\n        2.  Set $v_e = c$ (speed of light).\n        3.  Solve for $r$.\n    *   *Verification:* Does this match the GR definition? Yes, the Schwarzschild radius is defined as $r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$. The derivation is mathematically consistent, though physically, the Newtonian derivation is an approximation. The prompt specifically asks to derive it *from* escape velocity, so I must follow that path.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Goal 2: Time at the Event Horizon:**\n    *   *Concept:* Gravitational time dilation.\n    *   *Formula:* The time dilation factor $\\Delta t_{\\infty} = \\Delta t_{local} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}}$.\n    *   *Specific Case:* At the event horizon, $r = r_s$.\n    *   *Calculation:* Substitute $r = r_s$.\n        *   $\\Delta t_{",
