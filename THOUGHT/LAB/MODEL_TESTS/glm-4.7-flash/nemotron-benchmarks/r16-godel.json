  "result": "1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Topic:** Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.\n    *   **Specific Question:** How do they apply to AI?\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n    *   **Constraint:** Use Python for computation if needed (less likely for this conceptual question, but good to keep in mind).\n\n2.  **Part 1: Explain Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.**\n    *   *Context:* Kurt Gödel, 1931, mathematical logic.\n    *   *The Setting:* Formal axiomatic systems (like arithmetic).\n    *   *The First Theorem:* Any consistent formal system that is capable of expressing elementary arithmetic is incomplete. There exist statements in the language of the system that are neither provable nor disprovable within the system.\n    *   *The Second Theorem:* If a system is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency.\n    *   *Key Concepts:* Consistency, Completeness, Soundness, Formal Systems, Godel Numbers (encoding syntax as numbers).\n    *   *The \"Self-Reference\" Trick:* This is crucial. Gödel constructed a statement that essentially says \"This statement cannot be proven.\" If it's true, it's unprovable. If it's provable, the system is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **Part 2: Apply to AI.**\n    *   *Connection:* AI often relies on formal systems (logic programming, theorem proving, foundational mathematics) or seeks to simulate human reasoning (which Gödel suggests has limits).\n    *   *Direct Application (Formal Systems):* If an AI is built on a formal axiomatic system (e.g., a deductive engine), Gödel's theorems imply that there will always be truths about that system that the AI cannot derive.\n    *   *Indirect Application (General Intelligence):* If AI aims to be a \"universal\" or \"general\" intelligence (AGI), Gödel suggests that any system capable of describing arithmetic (and thus the world) has inherent limitations. It cannot be omniscient or perfectly consistent within itself.\n    *   *Neuro-symbolic AI:* Combining neural networks (which are probabilistic, not strictly formal) with symbolic logic. Gödel applies to the symbolic part.\n    *   *Limitations of LLMs (Large Language Models):* L",
