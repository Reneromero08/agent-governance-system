  "result": "The user wants me to calculate 25 * 37 and explain the steps.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to multiply 25 by 37.\n2.  **Identify the Method:** I can use standard multiplication algorithms (column method) or distributive properties (breaking down the numbers). I'll use the standard column method for clarity, but I might double-check with a distributive approach or estimation to ensure accuracy.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Execution:**\n    *   **Method 1: Standard Column Multiplication**\n        *   Write 37 on top and 25 below.\n        *   Multiply 25 by 7 (the ones digit of 37).\n            *   $5 \\times 7 = 35$. Write down 5, carry over 3.\n            *   $2 \\times 7 = 14$. Add the carry over 3: $14 + 3 = 17$.\n            *   So, the first partial product is 175.\n        *   Multiply 25 by 30 (the tens digit of 37).\n            *   $5 \\times 3 = 15$. Write down 0, carry over 1.\n            *   $2 \\times 3 = 6$. Add the carry over 1: $6 + 1 = 7$.\n            *   Since we are multiplying by 30, we add a placeholder 0 at the end.\n            *   So, the second partial product is 750.\n        *   Add the partial products: $175 + 750$.\n            *   $5 + 0 = 5$\n            *   $7 + 5 = 12$\n            *   $1 + 7 = 8$\n            *   Total: 925.\n    *   **Method 2: Distributive Property (Mental Math Check)**\n        *   $25 \\times 37 = 25 \\times (40 - 3)$\n        *   $= (25 \\times 40) - (25 \\times 3)$\n        *   $= 1000 - 75$\n        *   $= 925$\n    *   **Method 3: Alternative Decomposition**\n        *   $25 \\times 37 = 25 \\times (25 + 12)$\n        *   $= 25 \\times ",
