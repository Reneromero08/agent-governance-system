  "result": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants the fundamental groups of three specific topological spaces: the torus ($T^2$), the Klein bottle ($K$), and the real projective plane ($\\mathbb{RP}^2$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Spaces:**\n    *   **Torus ($T^2$):** The surface of a donut. It can be represented as $S^1 \\times S^1$.\n    *   **Klein Bottle ($K$):** A non-orientable surface. It can be constructed by gluing the sides of a square with specific identifications.\n    *   **Real Projective Plane ($\\mathbb{RP}^2$):** The set of lines through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It can be constructed by gluing the sides of a disk, or by identifying antipodal points on a sphere.\n\n3.  **Determine the Fundamental Groups:**\n\n    *   **Torus ($T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$):**\n        *   *Property:* The fundamental group of a product space is the product of the fundamental groups.\n        *   *Calculation:* $\\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^1) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\times \\pi_1(S^1)$.\n        *   *Result:* $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    *   **Klein Bottle ($K$):**\n        *   *Method 1: Van Kampen's Theorem.*\n            *   Decompose $K$ into two overlapping cylinders (or two Möbius strips).\n            *   Let $U$ and $V$ be open sets homeomorphic to cylinders.\n            *   $U \\cap V$ is an annulus (homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times (0,1)$).\n            *   $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n            *   $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n            *   The generators for $U$ and $V$ are loops around the \"long\" way around the bottle.\n            *   The generator for $",
