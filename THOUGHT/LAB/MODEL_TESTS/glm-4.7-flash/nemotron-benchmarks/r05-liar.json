  "result": "1.  **Analyze the User's Question:**\n    *   Statement: \"I am lying.\"\n    *   Question: Is he telling the truth?\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Concept:**\n    *   This is a classic logic puzzle known as the \"Liar Paradox\" or the Epimenides paradox.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Statement:**\n    *   Let $P$ be the proposition \"I am lying.\"\n    *   If $P$ is true, then the statement \"I am lying\" is true.\n    *   If the statement is true, then the speaker *is* lying.\n    *   If the speaker is lying, then the statement \"I am lying\" must be false.\n    *   This creates a contradiction: If $P$ is true, then $P$ is false. If $P$ is false, then $P$ is true.\n\n4.  **Determine the Logical Status:**\n    *   The statement leads to a paradox.\n    *   In classical logic, a paradox means the statement is neither true nor false (it is \"undecidable\" or \"paradoxical\").\n    *   In some interpretations (like Kripke's theory of truth), such statements are simply false or meaningless.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Answer:**\n    *   Acknowledge the paradox.\n    *   Explain the contradiction if we assume he is telling the truth.\n    *   Explain the contradiction if we assume he is lying.\n    *   Conclude that it is logically impossible for the statement to be either true or false in a standard binary logic system.\n\n6.  **Refine the Answer:**\n    *   Start with the direct answer: It creates a paradox.\n    *   Walk through the logic step-by-step.\n    *   Step 1: Assume he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, then \"I am lying\" is true. If \"I am lying\" is true, then he is lying. But if he is lying, he cannot be telling the truth. Contradiction.\n    *   Step 2: Assume he is lying. If he is lying, then \"I am lying\" is false. If \"I am lying\" is false, then he is not lying. If he is not lying, he is telling the truth. Contradiction.\n    *   Conclusion: The statement is logically inconsistent",
