  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Goal:** Write a regular expression (regex) for valid email addresses.\n    *   **Context:** The user wants a pattern that matches standard email addresses.\n\n2.  **Determine the Scope/Standard:**\n    *   Email specifications are complex (RFC 5322, RFC 6530, etc.).\n    *   A \"perfect\" regex is notoriously long and difficult to read/maintain.\n    *   A \"practical\" regex is usually preferred for validation (checking if something *looks* like an email).\n    *   I should provide a standard, robust regex that covers most common cases (local-part@domain.tld) without getting bogged down in the most obscure edge cases (like quoted strings or IP addresses in domains, though I might mention them).\n\n3.  **Drafting the Regex (Mental or Scratchpad):**\n\n    *   *Structure:* `local-part` + `@` + `domain`\n\n    *   *Local Part:*\n        *   Can contain letters, numbers, and special characters like `.` (dot), `_` (underscore), `%` (percent), `+` (plus), `-` (hyphen).\n        *   Cannot start or end with a dot.\n        *   Cannot have consecutive dots.\n        *   *Simplified pattern:* `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`\n\n    *   *Domain Part:*\n        *   Must have at least one dot (TLD).\n        *   Subdomains and TLDs consist of letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n        *   *Simplified pattern:* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`\n\n    *   *Putting it together:* `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`\n\n4.  **Refining the Regex:**\n\n    *   *The TLD part:* The previous pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` is good. It requires a dot and at least 2 letters at the end.\n    *   *Case Insensitivity:* Usually, flags like `re.IGNORECASE` are used, but the pattern itself can be case-insensitive or just use `i` flags. I'll stick to the pattern characters.\n\n5.  **Constructing",
