  "result": "1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Topic:** Shor's Algorithm.\n    *   **Requirements:** Explain step-by-step and explain *why* it breaks RSA.\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n    *   **Tools:** Python (for computation/verification if needed, though explanation is primary).\n\n2.  **Target Audience Analysis:**\n    *   The user wants a clear, logical explanation. It shouldn't be overly dense with jargon without definition, but it needs to be rigorous enough to explain *why* it works.\n    *   Structure: Introduction -> High-level concept -> Step-by-step breakdown -> Connection to RSA -> Conclusion.\n\n3.  **Core Concepts to Cover:**\n    *   Quantum Computing basics (Qubits, Superposition, Entanglement, Interference).\n    *   The Problem: Integer Factorization (RSA relies on this).\n    *   The Algorithm: Quantum Period Finding + Classical Reduction.\n    *   The Steps:\n        1.  Setup (QFT).\n        2.  Modular Exponentiation (The \"hard\" part).\n        3.  Quantum Fourier Transform (The \"magic\" part).\n        4.  Classical Post-processing (Continued Fractions).\n    *   The \"Why\": How factoring $N = p \\times q$ leads to breaking RSA.\n\n4.  **Drafting the Explanation - Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Introduction:** Define Shor's Algorithm. It's a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It runs in polynomial time ($O((\\log N)^3)$), whereas the best classical algorithm (General Number Field Sieve) is sub-exponential.\n\n    *   **The Mathematical Foundation (The \"Why\"):**\n        *   RSA relies on the difficulty of finding $p$ and $q$ given $N = p \\times q$.\n        *   If we can factor $N$, we can compute Euler's Totient function $\\phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)$.\n        *   Then we can compute the private key $d$ from the public key $e$.\n\n    *   **The Quantum Part (The \"How\"):**\n        *   *Key Insight:* Factorization is equivalent to finding the *period* (order) of a function.\n        *   Define $f(x) = a^x \\mod N$.
