  "result": "1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Question 1:** What are the best known bounds for $R(5,5)$?\n    *   **Question 2:** Why is $R(6,6)$ much harder?\n    *   **Context:** Ramsey Theory, Graph Theory, Combinatorics.\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct Question 1: Bounds for $R(5,5)$**\n    *   *Definition:* $R(s, t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that any red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ contains a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$.\n    *   *Known Values:* $R(3,3) = 6$, $R(4,4) = 18$.\n    *   *Current Status of $R(5,5)$:* It is not known exactly.\n    *   *Bounds:*\n        *   Lower bound: The best known lower bound is $43$. This was established by Exoo (2004) using computer search (constructive method).\n        *   Upper bound: The best known upper bound is $48$. This was established by Radziszowski and Xiao (2005) using a computer search (recursive method).\n    *   *Verification:* Let me double-check these numbers.\n        *   Exoo (2004): Lower bound 43.\n        *   Radziszowski (Dynamic Survey - Small Ramsey Numbers, 2021): Upper bound 48.\n        *   Yes, the current consensus is $43 \\le R(5,5) \\le 48$.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Question 2: Why is $R(6,6)$ much harder?**\n    *   *Magnitude:* The jump from $R(5,5)$ to $R(6,6)$ is massive.\n    *   *Theoretical Complexity:*\n        *   $R(5,5)$ involves looking for a $K_5$ in a specific context.\n        *   $R(6,6)$ involves looking for a $K_6$.\n        *   The number of potential subgraphs grows combinatorially. A $K_5$ has 10 edges. A $K_6$ has 15 edges.\n        *  ",
