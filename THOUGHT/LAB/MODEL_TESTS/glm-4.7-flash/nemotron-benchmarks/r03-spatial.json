  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Premise 1: Alice is not next to Carol.\n    *   Premise 2: Bob is left of Carol.\n    *   Question: Who's in the middle?\n\n2.  **Identify the Entities:** Alice, Bob, Carol.\n\n3.  **Analyze Premise 2 (Bob is left of Carol):**\n    *   This implies a linear arrangement (left-to-right).\n    *   Order so far: Bob ... Carol.\n    *   The positions are distinct.\n\n4.  **Analyze Premise 1 (Alice is not next to Carol):**\n    *   This restricts Alice's position relative to Carol.\n    *   Alice cannot be immediately to the left of Carol.\n    *   Alice cannot be immediately to the right of Carol.\n\n5.  **Determine the Total Number of Positions:**\n    *   There are 3 people: Alice, Bob, Carol.\n    *   In a linear arrangement of 3 people, there are exactly 3 positions: Left, Middle, Right.\n\n6.  **Deduce the Arrangement:**\n    *   We know Bob is left of Carol.\n    *   We know Alice is *not* next to Carol.\n    *   Let's test the possible positions for Alice.\n\n    *   *Scenario A: Alice is in the Middle.*\n        *   Arrangement: Bob - Alice - Carol.\n        *   Check Premise 2: Is Bob left of Carol? Yes.\n        *   Check Premise 1: Is Alice next to Carol? Yes (Alice is immediately left of Carol).\n        *   *Result:* This violates Premise 1. So, Alice is not in the middle.\n\n    *   *Scenario B: Alice is on the Left.*\n        *   Arrangement: Alice - Bob - Carol.\n        *   Check Premise 2: Is Bob left of Carol? Yes.\n        *   Check Premise 1: Is Alice next to Carol? No (Alice is separated by Bob).\n        *   *Result:* This satisfies both premises.\n\n    *   *Scenario C: Alice is on the Right.*\n        *   Arrangement: Bob - Carol - Alice.\n        *   Check Premise 2: Is Bob left of Carol? Yes.\n        *   Check Premise 1: Is Alice next to Carol? Yes (Alice",
