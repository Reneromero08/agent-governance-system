  "result": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the sum of all integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that satisfy two conditions:\n    *   Divisible by 3.\n    *   Not divisible by 5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Sets:**\n    *   Let $S$ be the set of integers from 1 to 1000.\n    *   Let $A$ be the subset of $S$ divisible by 3.\n    *   Let $B$ be the subset of $S$ divisible by 5.\n    *   The question asks for the sum of elements in $A \\setminus B$ (elements in $A$ that are *not* in $B$).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Sum of all numbers divisible by 3 (Set $A$).\n    *   Sum of all numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (Set $A \\cap B$).\n    *   Subtract the sum of Set $A \\cap B$ from the sum of Set $A$.\n    *   Formula: $\\text{Sum} = \\text{Sum}(A) - \\text{Sum}(A \\cap B)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Sum of Set $A$ (Divisible by 3):**\n    *   The sequence is $3, 6, 9, \\dots, 3k \\le 1000$.\n    *   Find the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 1000.\n        *   $1000 \\div 3 = 333.33\\dots$\n        *   So, the largest term is $3 \\times 333 = 999$.\n    *   Number of terms ($n_A$) = 333.\n    *   Sum formula for arithmetic progression: $S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a + (n-1)d)$.\n    *   Here, $a=3$, $d=3$, $n=333$.\n    *   $S_A = \\frac{333}{2} \\times (2(3) + (333-1)3)$.\n    *   $S_A = \\frac{333}{2} \\times (6 + 332 \\times 3)$.\n    *   $S_A = \\frac{",
