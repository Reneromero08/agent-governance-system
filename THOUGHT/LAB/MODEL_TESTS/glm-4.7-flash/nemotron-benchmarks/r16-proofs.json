  "result": "The user wants me to prove two classic mathematical results:\n1. There are infinitely many primes.\n2. $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nI will structure the response by addressing each proof separately, following the \"expert reasoning assistant\" persona.\n\n**Part 1: Prove there are infinitely many primes.**\n\n*   **Method:** Euclid's proof by contradiction is the standard and most elegant approach.\n*   **Step 1:** Assume the opposite. Assume there are only finitely many primes.\n*   **Step 2:** List them. Let the primes be $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$.\n*   **Step 3:** Construct a new number. Consider the number $N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot p_n + 1$.\n*   **Step 4:** Analyze $N$.\n    *   $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, \\dots, p_n$ because $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}$ for all $i$.\n    *   Therefore, $N$ must have a prime factor that is not in the list $p_1, \\dots, p_n$.\n    *   This contradicts the assumption that the list contained *all* primes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The assumption was false, so there are infinitely many primes.\n\n**Part 2: Prove $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.**\n\n*   **Method:** Proof by contradiction.\n*   **Step 1:** Assume the opposite. Assume $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational.\n*   **Step 2:** Express as a fraction. If $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, it can be written in lowest terms as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors (coprime).\n*   **Step 3:** Square both sides. $2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$.\n*   **Step 4:** Rearrange. $a^2 = 2b^2$.\n*   **Step 5:** Deduce properties of $a$. Since $a^2$ is even, $a$ must be even. (If $a$ were odd, $a^2$ would be odd).\n*   **Step 6:** Substitute",
