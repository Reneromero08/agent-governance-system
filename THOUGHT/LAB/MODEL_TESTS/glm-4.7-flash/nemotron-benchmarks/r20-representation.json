  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Part 1:** State Maschke's theorem.\n    *   **Part 2:** Compute character tables for $S_3$ (the symmetric group on 3 elements).\n    *   **Part 3:** Compute character tables for $A_4$ (the alternating group on 4 elements).\n\n2.  **Part 1: Maschke's Theorem:**\n    *   *Concept:* Representation theory of finite groups.\n    *   *Statement:* If $G$ is a finite group and $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $K$ with characteristic 0 (or characteristic $p$ not dividing $|G|$), then every $G$-invariant subspace $W$ of $V$ has a $G$-invariant complement.\n    *   *Implication:* This implies that every representation is semisimple (completely reducible), meaning it can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations.\n\n3.  **Part 2: Character Table for $S_3$:**\n    *   *Group Structure:* $S_3$ has order $6 = 2 \\times 3$. It is non-abelian.\n    *   *Conjugacy Classes:*\n        *   $e$ (identity): size 1\n        *   $(12), (13), (23)$ (transpositions): size 3\n        *   $(123), (132)$ (3-cycles): size 2\n    *   *Number of Irreps:* Equal to the number of conjugacy classes = 3.\n    *   *Degrees of Irreps:* Sum of squares of degrees = $|G| = 6$.\n        *   Possible partitions: $6 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2$.\n        *   Degrees: 1, 1, 2.\n    *   *Constructing the Table:*\n        *   **Trivial Rep ($\\chi_1$):** All characters are 1.\n        *   **Sign Rep ($\\chi_2$):** Characters are 1 for even permutations, -1 for odd permutations.\n            *   $e: 1$\n            *   $(12): -1$\n            *   $(123): 1$\n       ",
