  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Premise 1: Sally has 3 brothers.\n    *   Premise 2: Each brother has 2 sisters.\n    *   Question: How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Family Structure:**\n    *   Let $B$ be the set of brothers.\n    *   Let $S$ be the set of sisters.\n    *   Sally is a member of $S$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Premise 2 (The Key Clue):**\n    *   \"Each brother has 2 sisters.\"\n    *   This implies that for *any* brother in the family, the count of his sisters is 2.\n    *   Since Sally is a sister to her brothers, she is one of those 2 sisters.\n    *   Therefore, there must be exactly 2 girls in the family total.\n\n4.  **Verify with Premise 1:**\n    *   \"Sally has 3 brothers.\"\n    *   This means there are 3 boys in the family.\n    *   This is consistent with the family structure derived above (3 boys, 2 girls).\n\n5.  **Determine the Answer:**\n    *   The question asks: \"How many sisters does Sally have?\"\n    *   Sally is one of the 2 girls.\n    *   The other girl is her sister.\n    *   Therefore, Sally has 1 sister.\n\n6.  **Edge Case / Alternative Interpretation Check:**\n    *   Could \"sisters\" refer to stepsisters, half-sisters, or adopted sisters?\n    *   Usually, in these types of riddles, \"sisters\" implies full sisters unless specified otherwise. Even if they were half-sisters, the count remains the same.\n    *   Could there be more than 2 girls?\n        *   If there were 3 girls, each brother would have 3 sisters. The premise says each brother has 2 sisters. So, there cannot be 3 girls.\n        *   If there were 1 girl, each brother would have 1 sister. The premise says 2. So, there must be at least 2 girls.\n    *   Conclusion stands: There are exactly 2 girls in the family.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Total girls = 2.\n    *   Sally = ",
