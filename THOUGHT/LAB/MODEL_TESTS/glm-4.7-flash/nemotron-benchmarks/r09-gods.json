  "prompt": "Three gods named True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always lies, Random speaks randomly. They answer da/ja meaning yes/no but you don't know which. How do you identify them?",
  "result": "The user is asking for the solution to the classic \"Three Gods\" puzzle (also known as the Knights and Knaves puzzle, or the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever).\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to determine the identities of three gods (True, False, Random) based on their answers to yes/no questions. The answers are given in an unknown language (da/ja), and I don't know which word means yes and which means no.\n\n**2. Analyze the Constraints:**\n*   **True:** Always tells the truth.\n*   **False:** Always lies.\n*   **Random:** Speaks randomly (50/50 chance of yes/no, independent of the question).\n*   **Language:** Answers are \"da\" or \"ja\". I don't know which corresponds to \"yes\" or \"no\".\n*   **Constraint:** I can ask at most 3 questions total.\n\n**3. Strategy Formulation:**\nI need a way to force the gods to reveal their identity regardless of whether they lie, tell the truth, or speak randomly. I also need to handle the \"da/ja\" ambiguity.\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the meaning of \"da\" and \"ja\".**\n    *   I need a question where the answer is the same regardless of whether the god is True, False, or Random, and regardless of whether \"da\" means yes or no.\n    *   *Idea:* Ask a question about the answer itself. E.g., \"Is 2+2=4?\" If the god says \"da\", does that mean yes or no?\n    *   *Refinement:* If I ask \"Is the answer to this question 'da'?\", the answer depends on the god's nature.\n        *   If True: Truth. If answer is \"da\", says \"da\". If answer is \"ja\", says \"ja\".\n        *   If False: Lies. If answer is \"da\", says \"ja\". If answer is \"ja\", says \"da\".\n        *   If Random: Random.\n    *   *Better Idea (The \"da/ja\" trick):* Ask \"Does 'da' mean yes?\".\n        *   If True: If 'da' = yes, says yes. If 'da' = no, says no.\n        *   If False: If 'da' = yes, says no. If 'da'",
