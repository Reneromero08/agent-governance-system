  "prompt": "Write a function for longest common subsequence (return string, not length)",
  "result": "The user wants a function to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings.\nThe function should return the string itself, not just the length.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to implement the LCS algorithm and reconstruct the actual subsequence string.\n\n**2. Algorithm Selection:**\nThe standard dynamic programming approach for LCS is:\n- Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the first `i` characters of string `s1` and the first `j` characters of string `s2`.\n- Fill the table based on rules:\n    - If `s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n    - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n\nTo reconstruct the string, I need to backtrack from `dp[m][n]` (where `m` and `n` are lengths of `s1` and `s2`).\n- If characters match, add that character to the result and move diagonally up-left.\n- If they don't match, move in the direction of the larger value (up or left).\n\n**3. Implementation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the function.** Let's call it `longest_common_subsequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> str`.\n*   **Step 2: Handle edge cases.** If either string is empty, return an empty string.\n*   **Step 3: Initialize DP table.**\n    - Dimensions: `(len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1)`.\n    - Initialize with zeros.\n*   **Step 4: Fill the DP table.** Iterate through `s1` and `s2`.\n*   **Step 5: Backtrack to find the string.**\n    - Start at `i = len(s1)`, `j = len(s2)`.\n    - While `i > 0` and `j > 0`:\n        - If `s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`: This char is part of LCS. Add to result. Decrement `i` and `j`.\n        -",
