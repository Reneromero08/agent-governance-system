  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Statement:** \"Alice thinks Bob thinks that Alice thinks Bob is smart.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Parse this statement into logical components (who thinks what about whom).\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Sentence:**\n    *   The sentence is a nested structure of \"X thinks Y thinks Z\".\n    *   Let's break it down from the innermost layer outwards.\n\n    *   *Layer 1 (Innermost):* \"Bob is smart.\"\n        *   Who is being described? Bob.\n        *   What is the property? Smart.\n        *   Who is the subject of the thought? Alice (implied by the context of the whole sentence, but let's look at the next layer).\n\n    *   *Layer 2:* \"Alice thinks [Bob is smart].\"\n        *   Who thinks? Alice.\n        *   What does Alice think? That Bob is smart.\n\n    *   *Layer 3:* \"Bob thinks [Alice thinks Bob is smart].\"\n        *   Who thinks? Bob.\n        *   What does Bob think? That Alice thinks Bob is smart.\n\n    *   *Layer 4 (Outermost):* \"Alice thinks [Bob thinks [Alice thinks Bob is smart]].\"\n        *   Who thinks? Alice.\n        *   What does Alice think? That Bob thinks Alice thinks Bob is smart.\n\n3.  **Verify the Parsing:**\n    *   Let's re-read the original sentence: \"Alice thinks Bob thinks that Alice thinks Bob is smart.\"\n    *   Structure: [Alice thinks] [Bob thinks] [that Alice thinks] [Bob is smart].\n    *   Let's map the brackets:\n        *   `Alice thinks (Bob thinks (that Alice thinks (Bob is smart)))`\n    *   Let's check the \"that\" clause. \"that Alice thinks Bob is smart\" is the object of \"Bob thinks\".\n    *   Let's check the object of \"Alice thinks\". It is \"Bob thinks that Alice thinks Bob is smart\".\n\n4.  **Formalize the Logic (Mental Draft):**\n    *   Let $A$ = Alice, $B$ = Bob.\n    *   Let $S(x)$ = $x$ is smart.\n    *   Let $T(x, y)$ = $x$ thinks $y$.\n    *   The sentence structure is $",
