  "result": "The user is asking about the Collatz sequence starting from 27.\nI need to find two things:\n1.  The number of steps it takes to reach 1.\n2.  The maximum value reached during that sequence.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Collatz function:\n    *   If $n$ is even: $n / 2$\n    *   If $n$ is odd: $3n + 1$\n2.  Initialize variables:\n    *   Start value: 27\n    *   Step counter: 0\n    *   Max value: 27\n3.  Loop until $n$ becomes 1:\n    *   Update $n$ based on the rules.\n    *   Increment step counter.\n    *   Update max value if current $n$ is greater than previous max.\n4.  Output the final step count and max value.\n\n**Verification:**\nI recall that the Collatz sequence for 27 is famous for being quite long and having a high peak.\nLet's simulate this mentally or via code to be sure.\n\n**Code Execution:**\nI will write a Python script to calculate this precisely.\n\n```python\ndef collatz_sequence(n):\n    steps = 0\n    max_val = n\n    current = n\n    \n    while current != 1:\n        if current % 2 == 0:\n            current = current // 2\n        else:\n            current = 3 * current + 1\n        steps += 1\n        if current > max_val:\n            max_val = current\n            \n    return steps, max_val\n\nsteps, max_val = collatz_sequence(27)\nprint(f\"Steps: {steps}\")\nprint(f\"Max value: {max_val}\")\n```\n\n**Expected Result:**\nI've seen this specific sequence before.\nSteps: 111\nMax value: 9232\n\nLet's double check.\nSequence:\n27 -> 82 -> 41 -> 124 -> 62 -> 31 -> 94 -> 47 -> 142 -> 71 -> 214 -> 107 -> 322 -> 161 -> 484 -> 242 -> 121 -> 364 -> 182 -> 91 -> 274 -> 137 -> 412 -> 206 -> 103 -> 310 -> 155 -> 466 -> 233 -> 700 -> 350 -> 175 -> 5",
