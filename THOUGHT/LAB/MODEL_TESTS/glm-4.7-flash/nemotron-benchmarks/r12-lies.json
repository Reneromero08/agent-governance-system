  "result": "1.  **Analyze the user's input:**\n    *   Statement: \"You always lie.\"\n    *   Question: \"What color is the sky?\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints and nature of the prompt:**\n    *   The user is employing a classic \"liar paradox\" or \"knave\" logic puzzle setup.\n    *   The user claims I \"always lie.\"\n    *   The user asks a factual question (\"What color is the sky?\").\n\n3.  **Evaluate the truthfulness of the claim \"You always lie\":**\n    *   As an AI, I don't \"lie\" in the human sense (intentionally deceive). I provide information based on training data.\n    *   However, if I must accept the premise that the user is assigning a specific persona (a \"liar\" who always makes false statements), I need to analyze the consequences.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"Liar\" logic:**\n    *   *Premise:* The user claims I always lie.\n    *   *Scenario A (I accept the premise):* If I accept that I always lie, then any statement I make must be false.\n    *   *Scenario B (I reject the premise):* I am an AI, I don't lie. The premise is false.\n\n5.  **Determine the correct response strategy:**\n    *   If I answer \"The sky is blue,\" and I am a \"liar,\" then the statement \"The sky is blue\" must be false.\n    *   If the sky is *not* blue, what is it? It's usually blue, but technically, it depends on the atmosphere, time of day, etc.\n    *   However, the most robust logical approach to this specific riddle is to point out the contradiction or the nature of the question.\n\n6.  **Formulate the answer:**\n    *   If I say \"The sky is blue,\" and I am a liar, then the sky is *not* blue.\n    *   If I say \"The sky is not blue,\" and I am a liar, then the sky *is* blue.\n    *   This creates a paradox.\n    *   *Standard AI response to this riddle:* Acknowledge the paradox or simply state the fact, as the \"always lie\" constraint is a user imposition, not a fundamental truth about my nature.\n\n7.  **Ref",
