  "result": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The Riemann Hypothesis (RH).\n    *   **Specific Questions:**\n        1.  State the hypothesis precisely.\n        2.  Define the \"critical line\".\n        3.  Explain the implication for prime distribution.\n    *   **Role:** Expert reasoning assistant.\n    *   **Constraints:** Use Python for computation if needed (though this is a theoretical math question, I might use it to verify zeros or generate examples, but likely not necessary for the definition itself).\n\n2.  **Deconstruct Question 1: State the Riemann Hypothesis precisely.**\n    *   *Context:* Bernhard Riemann, 1859.\n    *   *Function:* The Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$.\n    *   *Domain:* Complex numbers $s = \\sigma + it$.\n    *   *Zeros:* The non-trivial zeros.\n    *   *Location:* The critical strip ($0 < \\sigma < 1$).\n    *   *The Hypothesis:* All non-trivial zeros have real part $\\sigma = 1/2$.\n    *   *Drafting the statement:* \"All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part equal to 1/2.\"\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Question 2: What is the critical line?**\n    *   *Definition:* The vertical line in the complex plane where the real part is constant.\n    *   *Value:* $\\sigma = 1/2$.\n    *   *Visual:* A vertical line running through $1/2$ on the real axis.\n    *   *Context:* It separates the \"critical strip\" (where zeros are suspected) from the rest of the complex plane.\n\n4.  **Deconstruct Question 3: What does it imply for prime distribution?**\n    *   *Connection:* Prime Number Theorem (PNT).\n    *   *PNT:* $\\pi(x) \\sim \\frac{x}{\\ln x}$. This is true regardless of RH.\n    *   *Error Term:* The difference between $\\pi(x)$ and $\\frac{x}{\\ln x}$.\n    *   *RH implication:* It bounds the error term.\n    *   *Specifics:* If RH is true, the error term is",
