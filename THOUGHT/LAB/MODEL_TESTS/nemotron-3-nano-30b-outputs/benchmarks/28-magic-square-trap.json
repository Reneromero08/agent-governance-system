        "content": "We need to output JSON array of headers for an academic paper describing this problem? The user asks a puzzle: \"TRAP PROBLEM: I have a 3x3 grid... Is this possible? If not, prove why not.\" They want us to act as a document structure analyzer and output JSON array of headers. So we need to parse the input text (the question) and identify logical section hierarchy.\n\nThe user gave only that prompt; no markdown headings. It's just a question. We must output ONLY a valid JSON array, each element with \"text\" and \"level\". The content likely includes sections like \"Problem Statement\", maybe \"Proof of Impossibility\"? But we need to infer the logical section hierarchy from the given text.\n\nThe input is not markdown headings; it's plain text describing a problem. We must output a JSON array representing headers. Since there are no explicit headings, perhaps we treat the whole as an abstract or introduction? The rules: Level 2 = major sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion). So maybe \"Problem Statement\" is level 2? But it's not exactly one of those names; but they said major sections like Abstract, Introduction,... Not limited to those words? They gave examples. Probably we can treat the question as a \"Problem Statement\" which would be level 2.\n\nBut there may also be subsections: maybe \"Impossibility Proof\". So hierarchy could be:\n\n- Problem Statement (level 2)\n   - Impossibility Proof (level 3)\n\nThus output JSON array of headers, each element separate? The example shows flat list of objects; they didn't nest. They just gave a list of objects with level numbers. So we need to output an array where each header is listed individually with its level.\n\nThus we could output something like:\n\n[{\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Impossibility Proof\",\"level\":3}]\n\nBut ensure valid JSON and no extra text.\n\nThe question: \"TRAP PROBLEM: I have a 3x3 grid... Is this possible? If not, prove why not.\" That's essentially the entire content. There are no subheadings indicated. So maybe just one header: \"Problem Statement\" level 2.\n\nBut they might want to treat the question as an \"Abstract\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Puzzle Description\". But we need to output only JSON array.\n\nGiven minimal info, perhaps best to output a single element with text \"Problem Statement\" level 2.\n\nBut maybe also include \"Proof of Impossibility\" level 3? The user asks \"Is this possible? If not, prove why not.\" That suggests the answer would involve a proof. But the question itself doesn't have headings; we are to identify logical section hierarchy. Possibly the hierarchy is just one major section: \"Problem Description\" (level 2). No subsections.\n\nThus output [{\"text\":\"Problem Description\",\"level\":2}].\n\nBut need to ensure text exactly matches a header? Not required to be exact phrase, just \"Section Name\". So we can choose appropriate name.\n\nI'll output:\n\n[{\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":2}]\n\nThat's a valid JSON array.\n\nCheck constraints: Output ONLY a valid JSON array - no explanation. No markdown code blocks. Start with [ and end with ]. So final answer is exactly that.\n</think>\n[{\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":2}]",
