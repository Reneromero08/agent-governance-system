        "content": "The user asks to state Riemann Hypothesis precisely, then explain non-trivial zeros, why Re(s)=1/2 is called critical line, and what hypothesis implies for prime number distribution.\n\nWe can answer comprehensively with precise statement: All nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part equal to 1/2. Provide definition of nontrivial zeros (zeros not at negative even integers). Explain critical line concept. Then discuss implications on prime number theorem error term, distribution of primes, bounds on pi(x), etc.\n\nWe can also mention consequences: better error bounds in PNT, results about gaps between primes, density hypotheses, etc. Provide precise phrasing.\n\nMake sure to be thorough.\n</think>\n**1. Precise statement of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH)**  \n\nLet  \n\n\\[\n\\zeta(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{s}}=\\prod_{p\\; \\text{prime}}\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}},\\qquad s\\in\\mathbb C,\\;\\Re(s)>1,\n\\]\n\nbe the Riemann zeta‑function analytically continued to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane with a single simple pole at \\(s=1\\).  \nThe **non‑trivial zeros** of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) are those zeros that are not the obvious “trivial’’ zeros at \\(-2,-4,-6,\\dots\\).  \n\n> **Riemann Hypothesis.** Every non‑trivial zero \\(\\rho\\) of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) satisfies  \n> \\[\n> \\boxed{\\Re(\\rho)=\\tfrac12 } .\n> \\]\n\nEquivalently, all zeros lie on the vertical line in the complex plane defined by \\(\\Re(s)=1/2\\), often called **the critical line**.\n\n---\n\n**2. Non‑trivial zeros of \\(\\zeta(s)\\)**  \n\n- *Trivial zeros*: The function \\(\\sin(\\pi s/2)\\) appears when \\(\\zeta(s)\\) is expressed via its functional equation, forcing \\(\\zeta(-2k)=0\\) for \\(k=1,2,\\dots\\). These are called **trivial** because they arise from the obvious zeros of the sine factor.\n\n- *Non‑trivial zeros*: All other zeros that appear in the critical strip  \n  \\[\n  0<\\Re(s)<1,\n  \\]\n  and are not at negative even integers. Numerically, billions of such zeros have been computed (e.g., \\( \\tfrac{1}{2}+i\\,14.1347\\ldots\\), \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}+i\\,21.0220\\ldots\\) etc.) and every one found so far lies on the line \\(\\Re(s)=\\frac12\\).  \n\nThus “non‑trivial zeros’’ = zeros of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) that are not \\(-2,-4,\\dots\\); they all lie in the critical strip, and RH asserts they actually lie on its centreline.\n\n---\n\n**3. Why Re\\((s)=½\\) is called the *critical line***  \n\nThe functional equation for \\(\\zeta(s)\\),\n\n\\[\n\\Lambda(s):=\\pi^{-s/2}\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\\zeta(s)\n\\qquad\\text{satisfies}\\qquad \n\\Lambda(s)=\\Lambda(1-s),\n\\]\n\nis symmetric with respect to the line \\( \\Re(s)=\\tfrac12\\).  \nConsequently, if \\(\\rho\\) is a zero of \\(\\zeta\\), then so are \\(1-\\rho\\), \\(\\overline{\\rho}\\), and \\(1-\\overline{\\rho}\\). This symmetry forces all zeros in the critical strip to occur in quadruplets symmetric about both the line \\(\\Re(s)=\\frac12\\) and the real axis.  \n\nThe **critical line** is therefore the vertical line \\(\\Re(s)=½\\); it is “critical’’ because:\n\n- Zeros of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) are known to lie *in* this strip, but no zero has been found off the line.\n- Many deep results (e.g., explicit formulas for prime counting functions) involve sums over zeros; if any zero were off the line, those formulas would acquire extra terms that would dramatically affect their consequences.\n\nHence “critical’’ denotes a line where the analytic structure of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) is especially sensitive and where conjectural regularities are expected.\n\n---\n\n**4. What RH would imply for the distribution of prime numbers**\n\nThe connection between zeros of \\(\\zeta\\) and primes comes from the explicit formula that links the zero set to the **prime‑counting function**  \n\n\\[\n\\pi(x)=\\#\\{p\\le x : p\\text{ is prime}\\},\n\\]\n\nand related functions such as the Chebyshev functions  \n\n\\[\n\\psi(x)=\\sum_{n\\le x}\\Lambda(n),\\qquad \n\\theta(x)=\\sum_{p\\le x}\\log p,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Lambda\\) is the von Mangoldt function. A standard explicit formula (derived from Perron’s inversion and the functional equation) reads, for \\(x>1\\),\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x)=x-\\sum_{\\rho} \\frac{x^{\\rho}}{\\rho}\n          -\\frac{\\zeta'(0)}{\\zeta(0)} - \\tfrac12\\log\\!\\bigl(1-x^{-2}\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum runs over **all non‑trivial zeros \\(\\rho\\)** of \\(\\zeta(s)\\).  \n\n### 4.1 Error term in the Prime Number Theorem (PNT)\n\nWithout any hypothesis, one can show that \\(\\psi(x)=x+O\\!\\bigl(x\\exp(-c\\sqrt{\\log x})\\bigr)\\) for some \\(c>0\\). If RH holds, every zero satisfies \\(\\rho=\\tfrac12+i\\gamma\\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n|x^{\\rho}| = x^{1/2}.\n\\]\n\nConsequently each term in the sum over zeros contributes at most  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^{1/2}}{|\\rho|} \\ll x^{1/2}\\log |t|\n\\quad (\\text{where } \\rho=\\tfrac12+i\\gamma).\n\\]\n\nSumming over all zeros with \\(|\\gamma|<T\\) gives a contribution \\(\\ll x^{1/2}T\\log T\\). Choosing \\(T\\approx\\sqrt{x}\\) yields\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x)=x+O\\!\\bigl(x^{1/2}\\log^2 x\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\n\\pi(x)=\\operatorname{Li}(x)+O\\!\\bigl(\\sqrt{x}\\,\\log x\\bigl).\n\\]\n\nThus RH **sharpens the error term** in the PNT from an exponential‑type bound to a power‑saving bound of order \\( \\sqrt{x}\\log^2 x\\).  \n\n### 4.2 Consequences for the distribution of primes\n\n- **Stronger bounds on gaps between consecutive primes.** Using explicit formulas together with zero‑free regions, RH implies that for sufficiently large \\(x\\) there is always a prime in \\([x,\\,x+O(x^{1/2}\\log x)]\\). This yields, for example,\n  \\[\n  p_{n+1}-p_n \\ll \\sqrt{p_n}\\,\\log p_n .\n  \\]\n\n- **Improved estimates for the Chebyshev functions** \\(\\theta(x)\\) and \\(\\psi(x)\\). The same \\(O(\\sqrt{x}\\log x)\\) bound gives precise control over fluctuations of these functions around their main term \\(x\\).\n\n- **Distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions.** Under RH, Dirichlet L‑functions satisfy analogous zero‑free regions, leading to error terms in the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions that are essentially optimal.\n\n- **Density hypotheses.** The Riemann Hypothesis implies the **Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH)** for Dirichlet L‑functions, which in turn yields results such as “the least quadratic non‑residue modulo \\(p\\) is \\(O(p^{1/2+\\varepsilon})\\)’’ and similar statements about Artin's conjecture on primitive roots.\n\n- **Conditional on RH, many equivalent statements become true.** For instance:\n  - Every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes (the weak Goldbach problem) is already known unconditionally; under RH one obtains a much stronger version with explicit bounds.\n  - The **Mertens conjecture** \\(\\bigl|\\sum_{n\\le x}\\mu(n)/n \\bigr|<1\\) would fail, but more subtle statements about the Möbius function’s partial sums acquire precise error terms.\n\nIn short, if every non‑trivial zero lies on the critical line, then the “noise’’ contributed by those zeros in explicit formulas is limited to a predictable \\(O(\\sqrt{x}\\log x)\\) size. This translates into **much tighter control over how primes are spaced and how irregular their distribution appears**, making the randomness of primes far more regular than it would be otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Riemann Hypothesis:** All non‑trivial zeros \\(\\rho\\) of \\(\\zeta(s)\\) satisfy \\(\\Re(\\rho)=\\tfrac12\\).\n- **Non‑trivial zeros** are those zeros in the critical strip \\(0<\\Re(s)<1\\), distinct from the trivial zeros at \\(-2,-4,\\dots\\).\n- The line \\(\\Re(s)=½\\) is called the *critical line* because of the functional equation’s symmetry and because all known non‑trivial zeros lie on it.\n- Assuming RH gives a dramatically sharper error term in the Prime Number Theorem (\\( \\psi(x)=x+O(\\sqrt{x}\\log^2 x)\\)), which propagates to tighter bounds for \\(\\pi(x)\\), gaps between consecutive primes, and various related arithmetic functions. This explains why proving RH is central",
