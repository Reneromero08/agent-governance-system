Must reason step-by-step, show reasoning, final answers. Provide details.\n\nWe should give overview, definitions, Maschke's theorem statement and proof sketch (using averaging inner product). Then compute irreducible representations of symmetric group S3: trivial, sign, 2-dim standard representation. Character table for S3 with conjugacy classes: [1], [transposition], [3-cycle]. Provide characters.\n\nThen A4: conjugacy classes: identity, three double transpositions? Wait A4 has elements: identity; three double transpositions (i.e., products of two disjoint transpositions) actually in A4 there are 3 double transpositions? Let's recall structure: A4 order 12. Conjugacy classes: identity (size 1), 8 3-cycles split into two conjugacy classes of size 4 each because they are not conjugate within A4? Actually in S4, all 3-cycles form a single class of size 8; but in A4 they split into two classes of size 4 (since centralizer sizes differ). Also there are three double transpositions: (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) forming one conjugacy class of size 3. So we have four conjugacy classes -> number of irreducible characters = 4.\n\nIrreps: trivial, sign? Actually A4 is not simple; its irreps dimensions: three 1-dim and one 3-dim? Let's recall representation theory of A4: It has four irreducible representations over C: three one-dimensional (trivial, and two others given by mapping the normal Klein-4 subgroup to complex roots of unity) and one three-dimensional standard representation. Actually there are exactly three linear characters because A4/[A4,A4] ≅ Z/3Z? Wait derived subgroup V_4 is normal; quotient A4/V_4 ≅ C3, so there are 3 linear characters factoring through that quotient (including trivial). So we have three 1-dim irreps. Then the remaining dimension: sum of squares must be |G|=12 => 1^2+1^2+1^2 + d^2 =12 => d=3. So one 3-dim irrep.\n\nWe need to derive character table for A4: list conjugacy classes and characters values for each irreducible representation.\n\nClass representatives:\nC1: identity (size 1)\nC2: three double transpositions (type (ab)(cd)) size 3\nC3: four 3-cycles of one orientation (e.g., (123), (132)? Actually there are two classes each of size 4). Let's denote C3 and C4 each with representatives (123) and (132). They are inverses.\n\nCharacters:\n- trivial: all entries 1.\n- chi_2, chi_3 correspond to mapping 3-cycle class to ω or ω^2? Actually linear characters factor through quotient of order 3, so they assign ω^k to the class of 3-cycles (both classes map to same value? Let's check). Since each 3-cycle class corresponds to elements of order 3; their images under a homomorphism to C* must be cube roots of unity. In A4 there are two conjugacy classes of 3-cycles that are inverses, so characters may assign ω or ω^2 depending on the character? Actually linear characters correspond to homomorphisms from A4 onto {1, ω, ω^2}. Since kernel is V_4 (size 4) and quotient cyclic order 3. So any element of order 3 maps to a primitive cube root of unity; but there are two nontrivial characters: one sends each 3-cycle to ω, the other to ω^2? But since the two classes are inverses, mapping to ω for class C3 and ω^2 for class C4 is consistent with being a homomorphism? Let's recall representation theory of A4: The three linear characters are:\n- χ1: trivial (value 1 on all)\n- χ2: sends double transpositions to 1; sends each 3-cycle to 1 as well? Wait they must be constant on conjugacy classes. Since V_4 is kernel, elements of V_4 map to identity. That includes identity and the three double transpositions (these are in V_4). So χ2,χ3 assign value 1 to class C2. For the two classes of 3-cycles, they assign ω or ω^2 respectively? Actually a homomorphism from A4 onto C3 must send each 3-cycle to generator of C3; but there are two nontrivial homomorphisms: one sends all 3-cycles (both classes) to ω; the other sends them to ω^2. However because class inversion may affect sign? Let's think: In quotient group A4/V_4 ≅ C3, the coset of a 3-cycle has order 3. There are two nontrivial elements in C3; they correspond to the two conjugacy classes of 3-cycles (since each class maps to one generator or its inverse). So linear characters can assign ω to one class and ω^2 to the other, but must be consistent: a homomorphism from A4 onto C3 factors through quotient mapping which sends both classes to either same element? Actually in quotient group of order 3, there are only two non-identity elements; they are inverses. So a character can assign ω to one class and ω^2 to the other (since those correspond to distinct nontrivial cosets). However a homomorphism must send each element to its image under the quotient map; but both classes correspond to different generators? Actually the quotient group C3 is cyclic of order 3, with elements {0,1,2} mod 3. The two non-identity elements are inverses (1 and 2). In A4/V_4, each conjugacy class of 3-cycles corresponds to one generator; but they might correspond to the same element? Let's recall: In S4, all 8 three-cycles form a single conjugacy class. In A4 they split into two classes because odd permutations are needed to swap them. So each class contains four elements, and they are inverses of each other across classes. Thus quotient map sends one class to generator g, the other to g^2. Therefore linear characters can assign ω or ω^2 accordingly; there will be exactly three linear characters: trivial (assign 1 to both), χ2 assigns ω on first class and ω^2 on second? Actually we need distinct homomorphisms: There are two nontrivial homomorphisms from C3 to C* given by sending generator to ω or ω^2. Compose with quotient map gives two characters that assign ω^k to each 3-cycle depending on which class it's in. So the character values for these two linear characters will be:\n- χ2: value 1 on identity and double transpositions; value ω on C3 (the class of (123) etc); value ω^2 on C4.\n- χ3: value 1 on identity and double transpositions; value ω^2 on C3; value ω on C4.\n\nThus the character table:\n\nClasses:\nC1: e, size 1\nC2: V = {(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)} size 3\nC3: (123), (132), (143), (134)? Actually four elements of one orientation.\nsize 4\nC4: inverses, also size 4\n\nCharacters:\nχ_triv: 1,1,1,1\nχ_ω: 1,1, ω, ω^2\nχ_{ω^2}: 1,1, ω^2, ω\nχ_3dim: dimension 3 representation: characters? Known values: For identity: 3; for double transpositions (order 2): -1; for each class of 3-cycles: 0. Because the standard 3-dim rep is the natural permutation representation on 4 points minus trivial subrep, but restricted to A4 yields that character.\n\nThus table:\n\n           |   C1   |   C2   |   C3   |   C4\nsize       |    1   |    3   |   4    |   4\nχ_triv     |    1   |    1   |   1    |   1\nχ_ω        |    1   |    1   |   ω    |   ω^2\nχ_{ω^2}    |    1   |    1   |   ω^2  |   ω\nχ_3dim     |    3   |   -1   |   0    |   0\n\nNow connection to Fourier analysis: Representations of finite groups give Fourier transform on functions defined on group; characters serve as frequency components; Plancherel theorem etc. For abelian groups, irreps are one-dimensional characters; Fourier transform diagonalizes convolution operators; for nonabelian groups we have matrix coefficients and Peter-Weyl theorem.\n\nWe need to explain connection: representation theory provides a way to decompose L^2(G) into direct sum of matrix algebras; characters correspond to traces; Fourier transform defined by mapping f(g) -> (sqrt(d_ρ/|G|)) * Σ_g f(g) ρ(g). This is analogous to discrete Fourier transform.\n\nNow answer: Provide explanation, derive character tables step-by-step.\n\nWe need to show reasoning steps for deriving S3 table. Let's do that:\n\nConjugacy classes of S3: identity (1), transpositions (size 3), 3-cycles (size 2). Irreps dimensions: squares sum =6 => possible dims: 1,1,2.\n\nFind characters using orthogonality and known facts.
