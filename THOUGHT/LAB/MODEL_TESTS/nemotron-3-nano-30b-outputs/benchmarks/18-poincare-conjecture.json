        "content": "We need to answer: explain Poincaré conjecture, Perelman's proof via Ricci flow with surgery, key steps, why declined prizes. Provide clear reasoning, structured. Include some details of Ricci flow, surgeries, monotonic quantities like entropy, no local collapsing, etc. Also mention his rejection of prizes citing disrespect and desire for freedom. Use accurate knowledge.\n\nWe should break into sections: definition, historical context; Perelman's approach; key steps (1) normalize metric via Ricci flow, (2) formation of singularities, (3) surgery to remove necks, (4) long-time existence after surgeries, (5) convergence to spherical space form; monotonic entropy functional ensures no local collapsing; etc. Then why declined prizes: he refused Millennium Prize money and Fields Medal because he believed the prize committees were corrupt or that mathematics should be free, also his philosophical stance.\n\nMake sure final answer is thorough.\n</think>\n**The Poincaré Conjecture**\n\n> *Every closed (compact without boundary), simply‑connected 3‑manifold is homeomorphic to the 3‑sphere \\(S^{3}\\).*  \n\nIn other words, if a three‑dimensional space has no “holes’’ (its fundamental group is trivial) and it is finite in extent, then it must be shaped exactly like the surface of an ordinary ball in \\(\\mathbb R^{4}\\).\n\nThe conjecture was posed by Henri Poincaré in 1904. It is the three‑dimensional analogue of the classical theorem that a simply‑connected closed surface in \\(\\mathbb R^{3}\\) is topologically a sphere. For decades it remained one of the most famous open problems in topology, and it became one of the seven **Millennium Prize Problems** (each worth \\$1 million) when the Clay Institute formulated its list in 2000.\n\n---\n\n## Perelman’s Proof Sketch  \nGrigori Perelman never wrote a traditional “paper” that was later peer‑reviewed; instead he posted three pre‑prints on the arXiv (2002–2003) and announced his results at several conferences. The proof rests on two deep ingredients:\n\n1. **Ricci flow with surgery** – evolving Riemannian metrics by a diffusion‑type equation and cutting out necks when singularities form.\n2. **Monotone entropy functional** – a nonlinear analogue of the Calabi–Yau entropy that controls the geometry during the flow.\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step outline of how these ideas combine to prove the conjecture for closed 3‑manifolds.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Ricci Flow: “Smoothening” the Geometry  \n\n- **Equation**: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial t}= -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))\\)   \n  (where \\(\\operatorname{Ric}\\) is the Ricci curvature tensor of \\(g(t)\\)).\n- Intuitively, the flow stretches directions with positive Ricci curvature and contracts those with negative curvature, smoothing out irregularities while preserving overall volume.\n\nIf we start with any smooth Riemannian metric on a closed 3‑manifold, Hamilton (1982) proved that the Ricci flow exists for a short time. Perelman extended this to show **long‑time behavior** can be understood by handling singularities carefully.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Formation of Singularities and “Surgery”  \n\n- As \\(t\\) increases, curvature tends to concentrate along lower‑dimensional submanifolds (often 1‑dimensional necks). At a finite time \\(T\\) a **singularity** forms: the curvature blows up somewhere.\n- Perelman’s key insight is that these singularities are *controlled*. He proved:\n  - No type‑III singularities can occur on closed manifolds.\n  - Only a finite collection of isolated “neck” regions (cylindrical, asymptotically \\(S^{1}\\times \\mathbb R\\)) can develop.\n- **Surgery**: When a neck becomes too thin, it is cut out and capped off with standard spherical caps. The resulting manifold has strictly lower volume but retains the same topology away from the removed region.\n\nThe surgery process is performed at discrete times \\(\\{t_i\\}\\) while keeping track of:\n  - **Normalized flow** (scale the metric to keep volume constant or curvature bounded).\n  - **Surgery parameters**: neck radius \\(\\rho\\), number of surgeries, etc.\n  - The **smoothness** after each operation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Entropy and No‑Local‑Collapsing  \n\nPerelman introduced a monotone quantity:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{F}(g,f)=\\int_M \\bigl(R+|\\nabla f|^{2}-f\\bigr) e^{-f}\\,d\\mu_g,\\qquad \n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}= -\\Delta f -R + |\\nabla f|^{2} - f .\n\\]\n\n- This functional never increases under the normalized Ricci flow (and surgery respects this monotonicity).\n- It provides a **no‑local‑collapsing** estimate: any ball of radius \\(r\\) contains at least \\(\\frac{c}{r^{n}}\\) volume, preventing geometry from collapsing into arbitrarily thin sheets without being detected.\n\nConsequences:\n  - The singular set has bounded curvature and dimension ≤ 2.\n  - After surgery, the flow can be continued indefinitely with controlled curvature bounds.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Long‑Time Existence & Convergence  \n\n- By repeatedly performing surgeries at each emerging neck, one obtains a sequence of metrics \\(g(t)\\) defined for all time on a *modified* manifold \\(M'\\) that is homeomorphic to the original.\n- Perelman showed that after an appropriate scaling limit (blowing up near singularities), the flow converges to a **round 3‑sphere** in finite time. In other words, each component of the normalized flow eventually looks like a standard sphere.\n\nWhen all surgeries are performed and the remaining pieces are glued back together, one obtains a closed manifold that is a quotient of \\(S^{3}\\) by a free action of a finite group (i.e., a spherical space form). Since our original manifold was simply‑connected, the only possibility is the trivial quotient—\\(S^{3}\\) itself.\n\nThus any closed, simply‑connected 3‑manifold must be homeomorphic to the 3‑sphere.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Summary of Key Steps  \n\n| Step | What Happens |\n|------|---------------|\n| **(i) Start** | Pick a smooth metric on the given closed 3‑manifold \\(M\\). |\n| **(ii) Ricci flow** | Evolve by \\(\\partial_t g = -2\\operatorname{Ric}\\). Curvature concentrates. |\n| **(iii) Detect singularities** | Identify necks where curvature blows up; measure their size via entropy monotone. |\n| **(iv) Surgery** | Cut out each neck and replace with standard caps, restarting the flow on the new manifold \\(M'\\). |\n| **(v) Continue indefinitely** | Use Perelman’s non‑collapsing estimate to keep control of geometry after every surgery. |\n| **(vi) Convergence** | After finitely many surgeries, the flow settles into a round sphere; the remaining pieces glue together to give a spherical space form. |\n| **(vii) Topology conclusion** | Because \\(M\\) was simply‑connected, that spherical space form is actually \\(S^{3}\\). Hence \\(M\\cong S^{3}\\) (homeomorphic). |\n\n---\n\n## Why Perelman Declined the Prizes  \n\n1. **Fields Medal (2006)** – The International Mathematical Union (IMU) awarded him the *only* Fields Medal ever given for work on a Millennium Problem. Perelman **refused** it, stating that:\n   - He considered himself still “in the middle of research” and did not feel his contributions were complete.\n   - He was uncomfortable accepting a prize that came with an expectation of public recognition; he valued mathematics as a *private* pursuit.\n\n2. **Millennium Prize (\\$1 million)** – The Clay Institute offered the monetary award for solving the Poincaré Conjecture. Perelman’s response:\n   - **Public letter** (“The Solution of the Poincaré Conjecture”, 2006) argued that the prize money should go to *others* who contributed to mathematics, not to him.\n   - He criticized what he saw as an *“institutionalized”* system: “I do not want to be paid for something I did out of love of mathematics.”\n   - He also expressed disappointment with the **political** aspects of awarding prizes (e.g., the need to sign a contract, public fanfare), which clashed with his ideal of *free* mathematical work.\n\n3. **Philosophical stance** – Perelman identified strongly with the tradition of “pure mathematics for its own sake.” He believed that monetary incentives would corrupt the spirit of discovery and lead to unnecessary competition and publicity. Consequently, he withdrew from the mathematical community altogether after 2006, living a reclusive life in St. Petersburg.\n\n> **In short:** Perelman declined both honors because he rejected any form of *external validation* or *commercialization* of his work; for him mathematics was an inherently personal, unfettered activity that should not be tied to awards or prize money.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR  \n\n- The Poincaré Conjecture asserts that a closed 3‑manifold with trivial fundamental group must be homeomorphic to the 3‑sphere.\n- Perelman proved it by evolving metrics via **Ricci flow**, performing controlled **surgeries** at singular necks, and using his monotone **entropy functional** to guarantee control over geometry.\n- The process smoothes any initial metric into a round sphere, proving that every simply‑connected closed 3‑manifold is \\(S^{3}\\).\n- He refused the Fields Medal and Millennium Prize because he disliked institutional recognition, wanted mathematics to remain “free,” and felt the prize structures conflicted with his personal values.",
