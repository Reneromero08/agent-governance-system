        "content": "We need to compute 2^67 - 1 and determine if it's prime. Known: Mersenne primes known up to certain exponents. Exponent 67 is not a Mersenne prime; I recall that 2^67-1 is composite, with factors perhaps known: It might have factor 193707721? No that's for exponent 31? Actually 2^31 -1 = 2147483647 (prime). For exponent 67, I think the smallest factor is something like 131071? Wait 2^17-1=131071 prime. For 67 maybe factor 275... Let's recall known factors of M_67 = 2^67 -1. According to known results, the smallest prime divisor is 274177? Actually that's for exponent 19? No 2^19-1 = 524287 (prime). For exponent 23 maybe factor 47? Not.\n\nLet’s search memory: Known factors of M_67 include 131071? That is 2^17 -1. But that doesn't divide 2^67-1 generally? Actually if p divides 2^n -1 then order of 2 modulo p divides n. So any prime factor q must be of form 2k*n+1? Actually for Mersenne numbers, any prime divisor p of 2^q -1 (where q is prime) must be congruent to 1 mod 2q. But exponent 67 is prime, so any prime divisor p must satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 2*67)=134. So smallest possible factor > 134.\n\nI recall that 2^67 -1 has a known factor 193707721? Wait that's for exponent 31? Actually 2^31-1 = 2147483647, prime. The factor 193707721 divides 2^31+1 maybe? Not.\n\nLet’s recall known factorization of M_67: According to known data, M_67 = 147573952589676412927. Its factorization includes prime factors: 193707721? Let's compute approximate magnitude: 2^67 ≈ 1.475739525896764e20? Actually 2^10=1024~1e3, so 2^67 = 2^(60)*2^7 ~ (1.15e18)*128 ≈ 1.47e20. So M_67 is about 1.4757e20 -1 ≈ 1.475739525896764e20? That's a 20-digit number: 147,573,952,589,676,412,927? Wait that's 2^67 exactly is 147,573,952,589,676,412,928. Subtract 1 gives 147,573,952,589,676,412,927. Yes.\n\nNow factorization: I think known factors are 193707721 and 1... maybe also 1? Let's search memory: For M_67, known small factor is 274177? That divides 2^23 -1? Actually 274177 divides 2^23-1? Not sure.\n\nLet’s recall known factors of Mersenne numbers with prime exponent up to maybe 100. I think for exponent 67, the factorization includes: 193707721 (which is 2*...?). Let's test congruence: 193,707,721 mod 134? Compute 134*1,445,... Actually 193,707,721 /134 ≈ 1,445, ... remainder? Not sure.\n\nBut I recall that the smallest prime factor of M_67 is 131071? No that's too small and doesn't satisfy modulo condition. Let's compute 131071 mod 134: 134*978 = 131, ... Actually 134*979=131,  134*979=131,... let's compute: 134*979 = 134*(1000-21)=134000-2814=131,186. That's far less than 131,071? Wait 131,071 < 131,186 so remainder negative; So not divisible.\n\nBetter to look up known factorization: I think M_67 = 2^67 -1 has factors: 193707721, 1... maybe also 5? Not. Actually let's recall from known list of smallest prime divisors for Mersenne exponents:\n\n- For exponent 2: factor 3\n- exponent 3: factor 7\n- exponent 5: factor 31\n- exponent 7: factor 127 (prime)\n- exponent 13: factor 8191? Actually 8191 is prime.\n- exponent 17: factor 131071 (prime)\n- exponent 19: factor 524287 (prime)\n- exponent 31: factor 2147483647 (prime)\n- exponent 61: factor? Actually M_61 is prime? I think it's composite with known factors.\n\nBut for exponent 67, I think it's composite with at least two known prime factors: 193707721 and  ... maybe also 53... Let’s search memory: The factorization of 2^67 -1 is:\n\n= 147573952589676412927 = 193707721 × 1? Actually compute 193,707,721 * something ≈ 1.475e20 / 1.937e8 ≈ 7.61e11. So quotient about 7.6e11. That could be composite further.\n\nI think known factorization includes three prime factors: 193707721,  443... Not sure.\n\nLet's quickly compute using known algebraic factorization? Not possible manually.\n\nBetter recall from known tables: For exponent 67, the known factorization is:\n\n2^67 - 1 = 147573952589676412927 = 193707721 × 1? Actually I think it's equal to 193707721 × 1? Let’s compute product: 193,707,721 * 7625597484987 =? That seems like 2^... Wait 7625597484987 is 3^something? Actually 3^something maybe.\n\nBut I recall that 2^67 -1 factorization includes the factor 193707721 and also  ... maybe  1? Let's search memory: The known factors of M_67 are:\n\n- p1 = 193707721\n- p2 =  85... Actually I think there is also factor  1? Let's check known factorization for exponent 67 from OEIS A000225? The factorization of M_67: It equals 147573952589676412927 = 193707721 ×  1? Let's compute quotient: 147,573,952,589,676,412,927 / 193,707,721 ≈ 762,559,748,498... Wait that's exactly 2^? Actually 762,559,748,4987 is 3^something? Let's compute: 2^? Actually 2^?? Not.\n\nBut I notice 7625597484987 appears as 3^... maybe 3^? 3^15 = 14348907; not. But 3^something large approx 7.6e12? Actually 3^25 ≈ 8.47e11, close.\n\nBut I think the quotient is 7625597484987 which itself may factor further: It might be  3 * something? Let's check known factorization of M_67 from literature: According to Wikipedia (I recall), M_67 = 147573952589676412927 = 193707721 ×  ... Actually the full factorization is:\n\n= 193707721 ×  1? Wait I think it's equal to 193707721 ×  5?? Not.\n\nLet me recall: M_67 = 2^67 -1 has known prime factors: 193707721,  4... Actually there is also factor  6361? No that's for exponent 13 maybe.\n\nBetter to search memory: I think the complete factorization includes three primes:\n\n- 193707721\n-  5? Not.\n-  89? Not.\n\nWait, I recall that M_67 = 147573952589676412927 =  193707721 ×  1? Actually maybe it's product of two primes: 193707721 and 7625597484987, where the latter is also prime? Let's test if 7625597484987 is prime. That number looks like 3^something? Actually 3^... let’s compute log10: log10(7.6e12) ~ 12.88, so about 13 digits. Could be prime.\n\nBut I think known factorization of M_67 includes three factors: 1937",
