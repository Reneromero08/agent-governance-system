        "content": "We need to answer: explain homology theory, define chain complexes, cycles, boundaries, compute homology groups H_n for sphere S^n (presumably), torus T^2, Klein bottle K. Also describe Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\n\nProvide thorough explanation with reasoning steps, definitions, then computations. Use standard results. Provide final answers.\n\nWe need to be careful: sphere S^2? Usually H_n of n-sphere is Z in dimensions 0 and n, zero otherwise. For torus T^2 = S^1×S^1, homology: H_0=Z, H_1=Z⊕Z, H_2=Z, others zero. Klein bottle K has H_0=Z, H_1=Z⊕Z/2? Actually H_1(K)=Z⊕Z/2, H_2(K)=0 (non-orientable). Let's verify: The homology of the Klein bottle: H_0 = Z; H_1 = Z ⊕ Z/2; H_2 = 0. Yes.\n\nWe also need to compute perhaps reduced homology? But likely ordinary singular homology.\n\nProvide explanation of chain complexes: sequence of abelian groups C_n connected by boundary maps ∂_n satisfying ∂_{n-1}∘∂_n=0. Cycles Z_n = ker ∂_n, boundaries B_n = im ∂_{n+1}. Homology H_n = Z_n / B_n.\n\nExplain chain complexes for simplicial or cellular homology.\n\nMayer-Vietoris: given a space X = U ∪ V with open sets covering, there is exact sequence ... → H_n(U∩V) → H_n(U)⊕H_n(V) → H_n(X) → H_{n-1}(U∩V) → ...\n\nProvide explanation.\n\nNow compute homology groups: need to show reasoning perhaps using known CW structures.\n\nFor sphere S^n, we can use cellular decomposition with one 0-cell and one n-cell; chain complex: ...→0→C_n=Z→C_{n-1}=...→0. Actually only nonzero at dimensions 0 and n. So H_0 = Z, H_n = Z, others zero.\n\nFor torus T^2: cell decomposition with one 0-cell, two 1-cells (a,b), one 2-cell attached via commutator [a,b]; chain complex yields boundary of 2-cell is a+b - ... but trivial because attaching map kills the commutator? Actually ∂_2 =0 so H_2=Z. For 1-chains: no boundaries from C_2, so Z_1 = free abelian on two generators; B_1 = im∂_2 =0, so H_1 = Z⊕Z.\n\nFor Klein bottle: cell decomposition with one 0-cell, two 1-cells (a,b), one 2-cell attached via a b a^{-1} b. That yields boundary ∂_2 = 2b? Actually in cellular homology for non-orientable surfaces the attaching map leads to relation that 2b is zero? Let's recall: The fundamental polygon of Klein bottle has edges identification: a,b with relations aba^{-1}b. In cellular chain, the attaching map of 2-cell yields ∂_2 = 2b (or maybe a b a^{-1} b maps to 0 in abelianization?). Compute using cellular homology: For non-orientable surfaces, H_2=0. The boundary map from C_2 to C_1 sends generator to 2*b? Actually the relation yields that the attaching map's image is (a+b - a +b)??? Let's recall standard result: The cellular chain complex for Klein bottle K has C_2 = Z, C_1 = Z⊕Z generated by a,b, C_0=Z. The boundary ∂_2 sends 1 to 2b (or maybe a+b - a + b?). In abelianization the relation gives that 2b =0? Wait: Actually in homology with integer coefficients, H_1(K)= Z⊕ Z/2 arises because one of the generators (say a) is infinite order, while the other (b) has order 2. The boundary map ∂_2 sends generator to 2b (i.e., twice the loop b). So im∂_2 = <2b>. Then H_1 = ker∂_1 / im∂_2; but ∂_1=0 because there is only one 0-cell, so kernel of ∂_1 = C_1 = Z⊕Z. Mod out by image generated by 2b yields quotient (Z⊕Z)/<2b> ≅ Z ⊕ Z/2 where the infinite part corresponds to a and b modulo 2 gives torsion.\n\nThus H_2=ker∂_2 / im∂_3; ∂_2 is injection? Actually ∂_2: Z → Z⊕Z sends 1→(0,2). Kernel is zero so H_2 = 0. Good.\n\nWe can present these computations succinctly.\n\nNow produce final answer with reasoning steps and final homology groups.\n\nAlso mention reduced homology maybe but not required.\n\nProceed to write structured explanation.\n</think>\n**Homology theory – a quick overview**\n\n1. **What we want to measure**  \n   Homology assigns an abelian group \\(H_n(X)\\) to a topological space \\(X\\) for each integer \\(n\\).  Roughly, \\(H_n(X)\\) records the “\\(n\\)-dimensional holes’’ of \\(X\\):  \n   * \\(H_0\\) counts path‑connected components.  \n   * \\(H_1\\) records loops that cannot be continuously shrunk (1‑holes).  \n   * \\(H_2\\) records 2‑dimensional voids, and so on.\n\n2. **Chain complexes** – the algebraic engine behind homology  \n\n   - A **chain complex** of abelian groups is a sequence  \n\n     \\[\n     \\cdots \\xrightarrow{\\;\\partial_{n+1}\\;} C_n \\xrightarrow{\\;\\partial_{n}\\;}\n     C_{n-1} \\xrightarrow{\\;\\partial_{n-1}\\;} \\cdots \n     \\]\n\n     where each \\(\\partial_i\\) (called a **boundary map**) satisfies  \n\n     \\[\n     \\partial_{i-1}\\circ\\partial_i = 0\\qquad\\text{for all } i .\n     \\]\n\n     In practice we build such a complex from a concrete cell or simplicial decomposition of \\(X\\).  \n       * The groups \\(C_n\\) are free abelian on the \\(n\\)-cells (or on the \\(n\\)-simplices).  \n       * \\(\\partial_n\\) records how each \\(n\\)-cell is attached to lower‑dimensional cells.\n\n   - **Cycles** and **boundaries**  \n\n     \\[\n     Z_n = \\ker(\\partial_n) \\qquad\\text{(chains with trivial boundary)} \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     B_n = \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_{n+1}) \\qquad\\text{(boundaries of \\((n+1)\\)-cells)} .\n     \\]\n\n   - **Homology groups** are the quotients  \n\n     \\[\n     H_n(X)= Z_n / B_n .\n     \\]\n\n     Intuitively, we declare two cycles to be equivalent if one can be written as a boundary of a higher‑dimensional chain.  The resulting quotient measures cycles “modulo trivial ones”.\n\n3. **How homology is actually computed**  \n\n   One common way is *cellular homology*: pick a CW–structure on \\(X\\) with cells \\(\\{e^n_\\alpha\\}\\).  \n   Then  \n\n   \\[\n   C_n = \\bigoplus_{\\alpha} \\mathbb Z\\langle e^n_\\alpha\\rangle ,\\qquad \n   \\partial_n(e^n_\\alpha)=\\sum_{\\beta}\\deg(\\phi_{\\alpha\\beta})\\,e^{n-1}_\\beta,\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(\\phi_{\\alpha\\beta}\\) is the attaching map of an \\(n\\)-cell to \\((n-1)\\)‑skeleton and \\(\\deg\\) denotes its degree (or, in general, the induced map on \\(\\mathbb Z\\)).  Computing kernels and images yields \\(H_n\\).\n\n---\n\n## Computing homology for three classic spaces  \n\nWe will use cellular decompositions that are standard and easy to write down.\n\n### 1.
