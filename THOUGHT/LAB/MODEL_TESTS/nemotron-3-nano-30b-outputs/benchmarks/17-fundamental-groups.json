Should be precise.\n</think>\n**Fundamental Group – What It Is**\n\nIn algebraic topology the *fundamental group* (also called the first homotopy group) of a topological space \\(X\\) based at a point \\(x_{0}\\in X\\),\n\n\\[\n\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=\\{\\,\\text{continuous maps } \\gamma:[0,1]\\to X\\mid \n\\gamma(0)=\\gamma(1)=x_{0}\\,\\}/\\{\\text{homotopy rel }\\{0,1\\}\\},\n\\]\n\nrecords how loops based at \\(x_{0}\\) can be deformed into one another without leaving \\(X\\).  \n\n* **Group operation:** concatenation of loops (follow one loop after the other) gives a binary operation that is associative up to homotopy and has an inverse (traversing a loop backwards). The constant loop at \\(x_{0}\\) serves as the identity element. Hence \\(\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\\) is a group.\n\n* **Why “fundamental”?**  It captures the most basic way in which the space can be “hole‑y’’ or “non‑trivial”. Different choices of basepoint give *conjugate* groups; for path‑connected spaces all basepoints yield isomorphic groups, so we often write simply \\(\\pi_{1}(X)\\).\n\n---\n\n## Computing \\(\\pi_{1}\\) for Three Classic Surfaces\n\n| Space | Typical Basepoint Choice | Resulting Fundamental Group \\(\\pi_{1}\\) |\n|-------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Torus** \\(T^{2}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}\\) | Any point \\((x_{0},y_{0})\\) | \\(\\displaystyle \\pi_{1}(T^{2})\\cong \\mathbb Z\\ast\\mathbb Z\\) (free abelian on two generators) |\n| **Klein bottle** \\(K\\) | Any point | \\(\\displaystyle \\pi_{1}(K)=\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}=b^{-1}\\rangle\\) (non‑abelian, one relation) |\n| **Real projective plane** \\(\\mathbb{RP}^{2}\\) | Any point | \\(\\displaystyle \\pi_{1}(\\mathbb{RP}^{2})\\cong\\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z\\) |\n\nBelow is the reasoning behind each computation.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Torus \\(T^{2}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}\\)\n\n* **Cellular decomposition**: one 0‑cell, two 1‑cells (the two circle factors), and one 2‑cell attached trivially.\n* The cellular chain complex for homology gives  \n  \\[ H_{1}(T^{2})\\cong \\mathbb Z\\oplus\\mathbb Z,\\qquad H_{2}(T^{2})\\cong \\mathbb Z .\n  \\]\n* For a CW‑complex, \\(\\pi_{1}\\) can be read off from the presentation coming from the 1‑skeleton: each 1‑cell contributes a generator; each 2‑cell contributes a relation equal to the boundary word of that cell.  \n  In \\(T^{2}\\) there is only one 2‑cell whose attaching map winds twice around each 1‑cell, giving no non‑trivial relation among the two generators (the attaching map is null‑homotopic in the 1‑skeleton). Hence we obtain a *free* group on two generators.\n* However, because of the 2‑cell that fills in the square, those two loops commute: going around one circle then the other yields the same loop as doing them in opposite order. Thus the presentation becomes  \n  \\[\n  \\pi_{1}(T^{2})\\cong\\langle a,b\\mid [a,b]=e\\rangle\\cong\\mathbb Z\\oplus\\mathbb Z .\n  \\]\n\n* **Intuitive picture**: imagine a doughnut; traveling around the “hole’’ (the central axis) and then around the “tube’’ can be swapped without changing the overall loop – they commute.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Klein Bottle \\(K\\)\n\nThe Klein bottle is usually described as a quotient of a square with edges identified as follows:\n\n* Horizontal edges are identified in opposite directions (giving the usual Möbius‑strip twist).\n* Vertical edges are identified in the same direction.\n\nTake a basepoint at the centre of the square. The 1‑skeleton consists of two circles: one for each pair of identified edges; call them \\(a\\) (horizontal) and \\(b\\) (vertical).  \n\nThe attaching map of the single 2‑cell runs along the word  \n\\[\naba^{-1}b .\n\\]\n(One traverses the horizontal edge, then goes up the vertical edge, returns opposite direction on the horizontal edge, and finally returns down the vertical edge.)\n\nThus a presentation for \\(\\pi_{1}(K)\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\pi_{1}(K)=\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}=b^{-1}\\rangle .\n\\]\n\n* This group is **non‑abelian** (the relation forces \\(a\\) to invert \\(b\\)).  \n* It can also be written as the semidirect product \\(\\mathbb Z\\rtimes\\mathbb Z\\) where the generator of the second copy acts by inversion on the first.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Real Projective Plane \\(\\mathbf{RP}^{2}\\)\n\n\\(\\mathbf{RP}^{2}\\) admits a cell structure with one cell in each dimension \\(0,1,2\\).  \nThe attaching map of the 2‑cell is the **double cover** of the 1‑skeleton (a circle) wrapped twice around itself. Consequently the relation coming from that 2‑cell is\n\n\\[\na^{2}=e,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) represents the unique generator coming from the single 1‑cell.\n\nHence\n\n\\[\n\\pi_{1}(\\mathbf{RP}^{2})\\cong\\langle a\\mid a^{2}=e\\rangle\\cong \\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z .\n\\]\n\nGeometrically, any loop in \\(\\mathbf{RP}^{2}\\) can be traversed twice to become contractible (because antipodal points are identified), so the only non‑trivial homotopy class is of order two.\n\n---\n\n## The Seifert–van Kampen Theorem\n\n### Statement (classical version)\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a topological space that is the union of two open, path‑connected subspaces  \n\\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that:\n\n1. Both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are **path‑connected**.\n2. Their intersection \\(U\\cap V\\) is also **path‑connected** (or at least each component of it is).\n3. The basepoint \\(x_{0}\\) lies in \\(U\\cap V\\).\n\nThen the induced homomorphisms  \n\\[\n\\iota_{*}: \\pi_{1}(U,x_{0})\\to\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0}),\\qquad \n\\jmath_{*}: \\pi_{1}(V,x_{0})\\to\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\n\\]\nfit into a **pushout diagram** of groups, which can be expressed concretely as\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\pi_{1}(X)\\;\\cong\\;\\pi_{1}(U)*_{\\;\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)}\\;\\pi_{1}(V)\n}\n\\]\n\ni.e. \\(\\pi_{1}(X)\\) is the *amalgamated free product* of \\(\\pi_{1}(U)\\) and \\(\\pi_{1}(V)\\) over their common subgroup \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\).  \n\nEquivalently, every loop in \\(X\\) can be written as a concatenation of pieces that lie wholly in \\(U\\) or wholly in \\(V\\); the only identifications come from how those pieces overlap in \\(U\\cap V\\).\n\n### When Can We Apply It?\n\n* **Open cover** (or at least subspaces whose interiors cover \\(X\\)).  \n* The intersections must be *nice* enough that \\(\\pi_{1}(U)\\), \\(\\pi_{1}(V)\\), and \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\) are known or easier to compute.  \n* If the intersection is not path‑connected, one works component‑wise; more generally there is a version for arbitrary covers using pushouts of *free products with amalgamation*.\n\n### How to Use It – Step‑by‑Step Procedure\n\nSuppose we want \\(\\pi_{1}(X)\\) and we have an open cover \\(X=U\\cup V\\).\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **0. Choose a basepoint** | Pick \\(x_{0}\\in U\\cap V\\). |\n| **1. Identify the pieces** | Determine simple subspaces \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) whose homotopy types (or known fundamental groups) are easy to compute. Often each is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of circles or a disk, etc. |\n| **2. Compute \\(\\pi_{1}(U)\\), \\(\\pi_{1}(V)\\)** | Use known results (e.g., \\(\\pi_{1}\\) of a circle is \\(\\mathbb Z\\), of a disc is trivial). |\n| **3. Compute \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\)** | Again, usually simpler than \\(X\\). |\n| **4. Determine the inclusion maps** | Find how \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\) embeds (or maps) into each of \\(\\pi_{1}(U)\\) and \\(\\pi_{1}(V)\\). This may involve deciding which loops in the intersection become trivial or identified with certain words in the larger groups. |\n| **5. Form the amalgamated free product** | Write down the presentation  \n  \\[\n  \\langle\\; a_i\\ (from\\,U),\\ b_j\\ (from\\,V)\\mid r_k\\ (relations\\ of\\,U),\\; s_\\ell\\ (relations\\ of\\,V),\\; \\iota_{*}(w)=\\jmath_{*}(w) \\;\\rangle,\n  \\]  \n  where \\(w\\) runs over a generating set of \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\). |\n| **6. Simplify** | Use the relations to cancel or combine generators, often ending with a familiar group (free abelian, dihedral, etc.). |\n\n### Example: Computing \\(\\pi_{1}\\) of the Torus via Van Kampen\n\nTake \\(T^{2}=S^{1}\\times S^{1}\\). Let  \n\n* \\(U\\) be a small open annular neighbourhood around the “horizontal” circle (homeomorphic to \\(S^{1}\\times(- \\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\)), deformation retracts onto that circle. Hence \\(\\pi_{1}(U)\\cong\\mathbb Z\\), generated by \\(a\\).  \n* \\(V\\) be an analogous vertical annulus, also homotopy equivalent to a circle; \\(\\pi_{1}(V)\\cong\\mathbb Z\\), generated by \\(b\\).  \n\nTheir intersection \\(U\\cap V\\) is a union of two disjoint open rectangles, each path‑connected after we choose a basepoint in one component and treat the other via the same inclusion (or simply take the whole intersection to be homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of two intervals—still trivial \\(\\pi_{1}\\)). For simplicity we can arrange that \\(U\\cap V\\) retracts onto a point, so \\(\\pi_{1}(U\\cap V)\\) is trivial.\n\nApplying van Kampen:  \n\n\\[\n\\pi_{1}(T^{2})\\cong \\pi_{1}(U)*_{\\{e\\}}\\;\\pi_{1}(V) \\;=\\; \\mathbb Z * \\{e\\} * \\mathbb Z \\cong \\mathbb Z*\\mathbb Z .\n\\]\n\nThe missing relation \\([a,b]=1\\) appears when we refine the cover to include a 2‑cell that fills in the square, forcing commutativity. This illustrates how van Kampen can be iterated with more refined open sets (e",
