        "content": "We need to output JSON array of headers only, with levels 2-5. The text is not markdown headings but we need to infer logical section hierarchy.\n\nThe user provided a short paragraph: \"Find all integer solutions to: x� + y� + z� = 33. This was an open problem until 2019. Explain the difficulty and what approach finally worked.\"\n\nWe need to output headers that would appear in an academic paper about this topic. Likely sections: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion etc.\n\nBut we must identify logical section hierarchy from the given markdown text? The user gave a single sentence? Actually they gave a description: \"Find all integer solutions to: x� + y� + z� = 33. This was an open problem until 2019. Explain the difficulty and what approach finally worked.\"\n\nWe need to output JSON array of headers only, no explanation.\n\nProbably we can produce something like:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"Abstract\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Introduction\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Background\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Difficulty of the Problem\",\"level\":4},\n {\"text\":\"Approach and Solution\",\"level\":4},\n {\"text\":\"Results\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Conclusion\",\"level\":2}\n]\n\nBut need to ensure each element has level 2-5. Also ignore figure captions etc.\n\nThe user wants \"Find all integer solutions... Explain the difficulty and what approach finally worked.\" So likely sections: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Problem Statement, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.\n\nWe must output only JSON array. No extra text.\n\nLet's craft a concise hierarchy with maybe 7 headers.\n\nLevels:\n\n- Level 2 major sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion\n\n- Level 3 subsections within those: Background, Approach, Findings\n\n- Level 4 minor headings: Difficulty, Technique\n\nBut we must keep each element level 2-5.\n\nWe can produce something like:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"Abstract\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Introduction\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Background\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":4},\n {\"text\":\"Methodology\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Results\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Discussion\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Conclusion\",\"level\":2}\n]\n\nBut need to ensure each level is between 2 and 5 inclusive. All are okay.\n\nWe must not exceed 50 headers; we have 8, fine.\n\nMake sure JSON array syntax correct: start with [ and end with ]. Each object has double quotes around text and numeric level without quotes? In example they used \"level\": 2 (no quotes). So we follow that.\n\nThus output:\n\n[{\"text\":\"Abstract\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Introduction\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Background\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":4},{\"text\":\"Methodology\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Results\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Discussion\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Conclusion\",\"level\":2}]\n\nCheck that \"Problem Statement\" includes space; okay.\n\nMake sure no extra commentary. Output only raw JSON.\n</think>\n[{\"text\":\"Abstract\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Introduction\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Background\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Problem Statement\",\"level\":4},{\"text\":\"Methodology\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Results\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Discussion\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Conclusion\",\"level\":2}]",
