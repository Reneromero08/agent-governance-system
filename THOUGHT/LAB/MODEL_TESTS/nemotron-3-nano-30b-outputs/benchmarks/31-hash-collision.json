        "content": "We need to output JSON array of headers only, no explanation. Identify logical section hierarchy from markdown text given. The input is a short paragraph with questions; likely headings may be implied but there are no explicit markdown heading markers (#). However the instruction: \"Given markdown text from an academic paper, identify the logical section hierarchy and output a JSON array of headers.\" Even if not marked with #, we can infer sections like \"Collision Detection\", maybe \"Why MD5 broke so badly\". But need to produce header entries with level 2-5.\n\nWe must output only valid JSON array. No extra text. Must start with [ and end with ]. Each element {\"text\":\"Section Name\",\"level\":2-5}. We need to decide appropriate levels.\n\nThe input: \"COLLISION DETECTION: In SHA-256, finding two inputs with the same hash should take ~2^128 operations. In MD5, collisions were found in 2^20 operations. Explain why MD5 broke so badly. What specific weakness did Wang exploit? Could the same attack work on SHA-256?\" This looks like a section titled \"Collision Detection:\" maybe level 2? Then subquestions maybe level 3?\n\nBut there are no explicit headings; we need to infer hierarchy. Possibly treat the whole as a single major section: \"Collision Detection\" (level 2). Then subpoints: \"Why MD5 broke so badly\" (level 3), \"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\" (level 3 or 4?), \"Applicability to SHA-256\" (level 3). Could also have sub-subsections.\n\nGiven limited content, we can produce maybe 3 headers: Collision Detection (level 2), Why MD5 broke so badly (level 3), Specific weakness exploited by Wang (level 4?) or level 3. Let's decide:\n\nLevel 2: \"Collision Detection\"\nLevel 3: \"Why MD5 broke so badly\"\nLevel 3: \"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\"\nLevel 3: \"Applicability to SHA-256\"\n\nBut we need to keep within max 50 headers, fine.\n\nWe must output JSON array only. Ensure proper quoting and commas.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"Collision Detection\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Why MD5 broke so badly\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\",\"level\":4? Actually maybe level 3 is sub-subsection? The rule: Level 3 = subsections within major sections. Level 4 = sub-subsections. So if we have multiple levels, we can assign accordingly.\n\nWe could treat \"Why MD5 broke so badly\" as level 3 (subsection). Then \"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\" as level 4 (sub-subsection). Then \"Applicability to SHA-256\" also level 4? Or maybe also level 3 if it's another subsection of same major section.\n\nBut we need consistent hierarchy. Let's structure:\n\nLevel 2: Collision Detection\nLevel 3: Why MD5 broke so badly\nLevel 4: Specific weakness exploited by Wang\nLevel 4: Could the same attack work on SHA-256?\n\nThus levels: 2,3,4,4.\n\nBut level numbers must be between 2 and 5 inclusive. That's fine.\n\nNow produce JSON array:\n\n[{\"text\":\"Collision Detection\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Why MD5 broke so badly\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\",\"level\":4},{\"text\":\"Could the same attack work on SHA-256?\",\"level\":4}]\n\nMake sure no extra whitespace? It's okay.\n\nReturn only that.\n</think>\n[{\"text\":\"Collision Detection\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Why MD5 broke so badly\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Specific weakness exploited by Wang\",\"level\":4},{\"text\":\"Could the same attack work on SHA-256?\",\"level\":4}]",
