It seems like maybe they want us to identify sections? Actually the prompt: \"Given markdown text from an academic paper, identify the logical section hierarchy and output a JSON array of headers.\" The user input is just a math problem statement, not a full markdown with headings. There may be no explicit headings indicated by # etc. Possibly there are implicit headings like \"Abstract\", \"Introduction\"? Not present. So we need to extract any section names? The text doesn't contain typical heading markers (#). But maybe they expect us to produce an empty array or something? However rules say each element has level 2-5, and must output a valid JSON array only. If there are no headers, perhaps output [] (empty array) which is still a valid JSON array.\n\nBut we need to consider \"Ignore figure captions, table headers, references list items\". There's nothing else.\n\nThus likely answer: [].\n\nBut maybe they want to treat the question as a section? The text doesn't have heading markers; but could be considered as an abstract or introduction? Not explicit. Probably empty array is safest.\n\nOutput must be raw JSON array only, no extra text.\n\nThus output [].\n</think>\n[]",
