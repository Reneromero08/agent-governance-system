        "content": "We need to compute expected number of fixed points when each person independently draws a random number from 1..100 with replacement? Wait: \"Each person is randomly assigned a number from 1-100 (with replacement).\" Means each person gets an independent uniform integer 1..100, possibly same numbers. There are 100 people labeled i=1..100. The random variable X_i = indicator that person i gets assigned number i. Then expected total fixed points X = sum_i X_i. By linearity of expectation, E[X] = sum_i P(person i gets own number) = 100 * (1/100) = 1.\n\nBut careful: With replacement means each draw independent uniform over {1,...,100}. So probability that person i receives number i is 1/100. Yes. So expected count = sum of probabilities = 100*(1/100)=1.\n\nThus answer: Expected number of people who get assigned their own number is 1.\n\nWe can also discuss linearity, independence not needed. Provide derivation.\n\nEdge cases? Not relevant.\n\nProvide final answer.\n</think>\n**Step‑by‑step reasoning using linearity of expectation**\n\n1. **Define indicator variables**  \n   For each person \\(i\\) (where \\(i = 1,\\dots ,100\\)) let  \n\n   \\[\n   X_i=\\begin{cases}\n   1 & \\text{if person } i \\text{ receives the number } i,\\\\[4pt]\n   0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the total count of “self‑matches”**  \n   The random variable we care about is  \n\n   \\[\n   X = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} X_i,\n   \\]\n\n   i.e., \\(X\\) counts how many people get assigned their own number.\n\n3. **Apply linearity of expectation**  \n   Linearity holds regardless of any dependence among the \\(X_i\\)’s, so  \n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbb{E}[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^{100}\\mathbb{E}[X_i].\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_i]\\) for a single person**  \n   Each person draws a number independently and uniformly from \\(\\{1,\\dots ,100\\}\\).  \n   Hence  \n\n   \\[\n   \\Pr\\bigl(\\text{person } i \\text{ gets number } i\\bigr)=\\frac{1}{100}.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore  \n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbb{E}[X_i]=\\Pr(X_i=1)= \\frac{1}{100},\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \n   \\mathbb{E}[X_i]=0\\cdot\\bigl(1-\\tfrac{1}{100}\\bigr)+\\!1\\cdot\\tfrac{1}{100}= \\tfrac{1}{100}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sum over all 100 people**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbb{E}[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\frac{1}{100}\n                = 100\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=1.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,\\mathbb{E}[\\text{# of people who receive their own number}] = 1\\,}\n\\]\n\nThe expectation is exactly 1, because each of the 100 people has a \\(1/100\\) chance of getting their own label, and linearity of expectation simply adds those probabilities. The draws are independent (with replacement), but independence is not required for this result; only uniform marginal probability matters.",
