        "content": "We need to derive Schwarzschild radius using escape velocity approach, showing steps leading to rs = 2GM/c^2. Then explain gravitational time dilation at event horizon: coordinate time vs proper time, redshift, etc.\n\nProvide reasoning, equations, approximations, and mention limitations of Newtonian derivation but it yields correct factor of 2. Then discuss time behavior near horizon: infinite gravitational redshift, stationary observer requires infinite acceleration; from perspective of distant observer, clocks appear to freeze; proper time remains finite for infalling observer.\n\nWe should be thorough, show steps:\n\n- Escape velocity v_esc = sqrt(2GM/r)\n- Set equal to speed of light c at r = rs => v_esc=c => c^2 = 2GM/rs => rs=2GM/c^2\n- Note that this is not rigorous in GR but gives same factor.\n\nThen discuss Schwarzschild metric: g_tt = -(1 - 2GM/(rc^2)). At horizon r_s, g_tt -> 0. So proper time dτ relates to coordinate time dt by dτ = sqrt(1-rs/r) dt. As r→rs, factor →0 => for fixed dt, dτ→0; conversely for finite dτ you need infinite dt: external observer sees clocks freeze.\n\nExplain gravitational redshift: frequency observed at infinity f_∞ = f_local * sqrt(1 - rs/r). At horizon redshift goes to zero.\n\nAlso mention that proper time for infalling observer remains finite crossing horizon, while coordinate time diverges.\n\nProvide final answer.\n</think>\n**Deriving the Schwarzschild radius from an “escape‑velocity” argument**\n\nThe Newtonian escape‑velocity formula tells us the speed \\(v_{\\rm esc}\\) that a test particle must have at distance \\(r\\) from a spherical mass \\(M\\) in order to reach infinity with zero residual kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\n\\frac12 m v_{\\rm esc}^{2}= \\frac{GMm}{r}\\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \nv_{\\rm esc}(r)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} .\n\\]\n\nIf we *pretend* that the same relationship holds in the relativistic regime, then the escape speed can never exceed the speed of light \\(c\\).  \nSetting \\(v_{\\rm esc}=c\\) and solving for the radius at which this happens gives\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nc^{2}= \\frac{2GM}{r}\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\boxed{r_{s}= \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} } .\n\\]\n\nThus the radius at which the Newtonian escape speed equals \\(c\\) is exactly the Schwarzschild radius.  \nIn General Relativity this result emerges more rigorously from the metric of a static, spherically symmetric vacuum spacetime (the Schwarzschild solution).  The condition that the coefficient of \\(dt^{2}\\) in the line element vanish reproduces the same expression:\n\n\\[\nds^{2}= -\\left(1-\\frac{2GM}{rc^{2}}\\right)c^{2}dt^{2}+ \\dots,\n\\]\nso the surface where \\(1-2GM/(rc^{2})=0\\) is precisely \\(r=r_{s}\\).\n\n---\n\n### What happens to **time** at the event horizon?\n\nIn Schwarzschild coordinates \\((t,r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) the line element near the horizon reads\n\n\\[\nds^{2}= -\\underbrace{\\left(1-\\frac{r_{s}}{r}\\right)}_{\\displaystyle g_{tt}}\\,c^{2}dt^{2}\n      +\\frac{dr^{2}}{1-r_{s}/r}+ r^{2}d\\Omega^{2},\n\\qquad\\text{with }r_{s}=\\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} .\n\\]\n\n- **\\(g_{tt}= -(1-r_{s}/r)\\)** is the *time‑component* of the metric.  \n  At \\(r=r_{s}\\) this component goes to zero, i.e. \\(g_{tt}\\to0\\).\n\n- The proper time interval measured by a clock at fixed \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) is\n\n\\[\nd\\tau = \\sqrt{-\\frac{g_{tt}}{c^{2}}}\\,dt \n      = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{s}}{r}}\\; dt .\n\\]\n\n  As \\(r\\rightarrow r_{s}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{s}}{r}}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;0,\n\\qquad\\text{so}\\qquad d\\tau\\;\\to\\;0\\ \\text{for any finite }dt .\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation**\n\n| Perspective | What is observed |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| **Distant observer (constant \\(t\\))** | The proper time of a clock hovering just above the horizon ticks ever more slowly.  To keep \\(d\\tau\\) finite, an infinite coordinate time \\(t\\) would be required; thus the distant observer sees the infalling or hovering clock “freeze” at the horizon. |\n| **Infalling observer (moving radially)** | Proper time along his world‑line remains perfectly regular and reaches zero only when he hits the singularity at \\(r=0\\).  He can cross \\(r=r_{s}\\) in a finite amount of his own proper time, with no locally detectable “wall”. |\n| **Signal redshift** | Light emitted from radius \\(r\\) is observed at infinity with frequency  \n\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\infty}= \\nu_{\\rm emit}\\,\\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{s}}{r}} .\n\\]\n\n  As \\(r\\to r_{s}\\) the factor \\(\\sqrt{1-r_{s}/r}\\to0\\), so the emitted signal’s frequency is red‑shifted to zero.  In other words, any photon trying to climb out from exactly at the horizon would be infinitely red‑shifted and never reach a distant observer.\n\nThus **time behaves dramatically at the event horizon**: for a stationary observer at fixed \\(r\\) the coordinate time required for a given amount of proper time diverges, making external clocks appear to stop.  For any freely falling observer, however, proper time remains finite all the way through the horizon; only at the central singularity does curvature become infinite and the classical notion of spacetime breaks down.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n1. **Derivation** – By equating the Newtonian escape speed \\(\\sqrt{2GM/r}\\) to \\(c\\) we obtain  \n   \\[\n   r_{s}= \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} .\n   \\]\n   In full General Relativity this radius is exactly where the Schwarzschild metric’s time coefficient vanishes.\n\n2. **Time at the horizon** – The metric component \\(g_{tt}=-(1-r_{s}/r)\\) goes to zero, causing a proper‑time factor \\(\\sqrt{1-r_{s}/r}\\) to vanish.  Consequently:\n   - To an observer at infinity, clocks arbitrarily close to \\(r_{s}\\) appear to **stop** (infinite redshift, infinite coordinate time needed).\n   - A locally free‑falling observer experiences **no singular behavior** at the horizon; his proper time proceeds normally and he can cross it in finite own‑time.\n   - Any light emitted from exactly \\(r=r_{s}\\) is infinitely red‑shifted and never reaches infinity.\n\nThese statements capture the essential relativistic meaning of “the event horizon” as a surface where the escape velocity equals the speed of light, and where the flow of coordinate time stretches to infinity relative to distant observers.",
