        "content": "We need to produce rigorous proofs by contradiction: Euclid's proof infinite primes; and sqrt(2) irrational. Provide reasoning steps, assumptions, contradictions. Use formal structure. Ensure completeness.\n</think>\n**Proof 1 – There are infinitely many prime numbers (Euclid’s classic argument)**  \n\n*Goal.* Show that for every finite set of primes there exists at least one more prime not in the set; consequently no finite list can contain all primes.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Assumption for contradiction  \nSuppose, to the contrary, that only finitely many primes exist.  \nLet us denote them by  \n\n\\[\np_{1}, p_{2},\\dots ,p_{k}\n\\]\n\nwhere each \\(p_i\\) is a prime and every prime belongs to this list.\n\n### 2. Construct a new integer  \nDefine  \n\n\\[\nN = p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{k}+1 .\n\\]\n\n\\(N\\) is an integer larger than 1, so it must possess at least one prime divisor (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).\n\n### 3. Examine the possible divisors of \\(N\\)\n\n* For each \\(i\\in\\{1,\\dots ,k\\}\\) we have  \n\n\\[\np_i \\mid p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{k}.\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n\\[\np_i \\mid (p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{k}+1) - p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{k}=1 .\n\\]\n\nThus \\(p_i\\) would divide 1, which is impossible for any prime \\(p_i>1\\).\n\n* Consequently **no** of the listed primes \\(p_1,\\dots ,p_k\\) can divide \\(N\\).\n\n### 4. Derive a contradiction  \n\nSince every integer greater than 1 has at least one prime divisor, \\(N\\) must have some prime divisor \\(q\\). By Step 3 this divisor cannot be any of the finitely many primes listed; hence \\(q\\) is a prime not in \\(\\{p_1,\\dots ,p_k\\}\\). This contradicts the assumption that the set \\(\\{p_1,\\dots ,p_k\\}\\) contained *all* primes.\n\n### 5. Conclusion  \n\nThe supposition that there are only finitely many primes leads to an impossibility; therefore **there must be infinitely many prime numbers**. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Proof 2 – \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational (again by contradiction)**  \n\n*Goal.* Show that no rational number equals \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Assumption for contradiction  \nAssume, to the contrary, that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational. Then there exist **coprime** integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(b\\neq0\\) such that  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}= \\frac{a}{b}.\n\\]\n\n(“Coprime” means \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\); we may always reduce a fraction to this form.)\n\n### 2. Square both sides  \n\n\\[\n2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^{2}\n\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\n2b^{2}=a^{2}. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nThus \\(a^{2}\\) is an even integer (it equals twice something).\n\n### 3. Infer parity of \\(a\\)\n\nIf a square is even, its base must be even; therefore \\(a\\) itself is even.  \nHence we can write  \n\n\\[\na = 2c \\quad\\text{for some integer }c.\n\\]\n\n### 4. Substitute back into (1)\n\n\\[\n2b^{2}= (2c)^{2}=4c^{2}\n\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\nb^{2}=2c^{2}. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nEquation (2) shows that \\(b^{2}\\) is also even, and consequently **\\(b\\) must be even** as well.\n\n### 5. Contradiction with coprimality  \n\nWe have shown that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are divisible by 2; i.e.,  \n\n\\[\n2\\mid a \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 2\\mid b.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(\\gcd(a,b)\\ge 2\\), contradicting the requirement that \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\).\n\n### 6. Conclusion  \n\nThe assumption that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed as a ratio of two integers leads to an impossibility; therefore **\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational**. ∎\n\n\n\n---  \n\nBoth arguments are presented in a fully rigorous, step‑by‑step fashion and each proceeds by assuming the contrary and deriving a logical contradiction.",
