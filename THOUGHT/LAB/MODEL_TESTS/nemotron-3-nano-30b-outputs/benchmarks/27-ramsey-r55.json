        "content": "We need to output JSON array of headers only. The user asks: \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number? Give the best known bounds and explain why finding the exact value is so hard. Erdos famously said if aliens demanded R(5,5) or they'd destroy Earth, we should try to compute it. If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\" We need to identify logical section hierarchy in this markdown text. Likely headings: maybe \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\" could be a heading level 2? Then subsections: \"Best known bounds\", \"Why finding exact value is hard\", \"Erdos' remark about aliens and R(5,5)\", \"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\" Might be multiple levels.\n\nWe need to output JSON array of objects with text and level (2-5). No extra commentary. Must be valid JSON array only.\n\nLet's think: The markdown likely has headings indicated by #? Not given but we can infer typical structure:\n\nPossibility:\n# What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\n## Best known bounds\n### Why finding exact value is hard\n## Erdos' famous comment about aliens demanding R(5,5)\n### If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\n\nBut we need to output headers only; each header's text and level.\n\nWe must decide levels: major sections are level 2 (Abstract, Introduction...). In this context, maybe the top-level heading is level 2? Actually rule says Level 2 = major sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion). But here we have a different structure; but we can still assign level based on hierarchy: top-level headings are level 2? Or maybe they want to map markdown heading levels to our internal levels: e.g., # is level 2? Actually rule says Level 2 = major sections (Abstract, Introduction...). That's just an example. In general, we can treat headings as level 2 for top-level headings, level 3 for subsections, etc.\n\nThus we need to output something like:\n\n[{\"text\":\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Best known bounds\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Why finding exact value is hard\",\"level\":4}... maybe also \"Erdos' famous comment about aliens demanding R(5,5)\",\"level\":3? Or level 3? Let's decide.\n\nBut we need to be careful: The user didn't provide explicit markdown headings; they just gave a paragraph. We must identify logical section hierarchy from the text. Possibly there are no explicit heading markers, but we can infer sections based on content breaks.\n\nThe text:\n\n\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number? Give the best known bounds and explain why finding the exact value is so hard. Erdos famously said if aliens demanded R(5,5) or they'd destroy Earth, we should try to compute it. If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\"\n\nThis seems like a single paragraph with maybe two logical sections: one about definition and bounds, another about difficulty and Erdos comment, then about R(6,6). But we need to output headers. Possibly we can treat \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\" as a heading level 2. Then \"Give the best known bounds and explain why finding the exact value is so hard\" could be a subheading level 3. Then \"Erdos famously said ...\" maybe another subheading? Or \"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\" maybe another heading.\n\nBut we must output only JSON array of headers; no extra text.\n\nWe need to decide the levels: Level 2 major sections; level 3 subsections; level 4 sub-subsections; level 5 minor headings.\n\nGiven typical structure, I'd propose:\n\n- \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\" as level 2 (major section)\n- \"Best known bounds\" as level 3 (subsection)\n- \"Why finding exact value is hard\" as level 4? Or maybe also level 3. But we need to keep hierarchical consistency.\n\nBut the instruction says: Level 2 = major sections; Level 3 = subsections within major sections; Level 4 = sub-subsections; Level 5 = minor headings, definitions, lemmas.\n\nThus we can have:\n\nLevel 2: \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\"\nLevel 3: \"Best known bounds\"\nLevel 3: \"Why finding exact value is hard\"\nLevel 3: \"Erdos' famous remark about aliens demanding R(5,5)\"\nLevel 3: \"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\" maybe also level 3.\n\nBut we need to keep under 50 headers; that's fine.\n\nWe must output JSON array with each element having \"text\" and \"level\". The text should be exactly the header text as appears? Probably without surrounding punctuation? Use the phrase as is but maybe trimmed.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Best known bounds\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Why finding exact value is hard\",\"level\":4}, // maybe level 4 because it's a deeper explanation?\n {\"text\":\"Erdos' remark about aliens demanding R(5,5)\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\",\"level\":3}\n]\n\nBut need to ensure levels are consistent: If \"Why finding exact value is hard\" is a sub-subsection of \"Best known bounds\"? Actually it's part of the same major section maybe but could be level 4. However we can also keep all at level 3.\n\nBetter to have:\n\nLevel 2: \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\"\nLevel 3: \"Best known bounds\"\nLevel 3: \"Why finding exact value is hard\"\nLevel 3: \"Erdos' famous comment on alien demands\"\nLevel 3: \"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\"\n\nThus all level 3 except the top.\n\nBut rule says Level 2 = major sections; but here we only have one major section? Possibly the whole text is a single section titled \"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\" and everything else is subsections.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Best known bounds\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Why finding exact value is hard\",\"level\":4}, // maybe level 4 because it's a deeper explanation?\n {\"text\":\"Erdos' famous comment on alien demands\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\",\"level\":3}\n]\n\nBut level 4 might be okay if it's a sub-subsection. However the text \"Why finding exact value is hard\" could be considered a subsection of \"Best known bounds\"? Actually it's explaining difficulty; maybe it's separate but still same level as \"Best known bounds\". Could be level 3.\n\nBetter to keep all subsections at level 3.\n\nThus final JSON:\n\n[\n {\"text\":\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\",\"level\":2},\n {\"text\":\"Best known bounds\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Why finding exact value is hard\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"Erdos' famous comment on alien demands\",\"level\":3},\n {\"text\":\"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack. Why?\",\"level\":3}\n]\n\nCheck rule: Each element must have \"text\" and \"level\". Level values 2-5. Our levels are 2 and 3, which is allowed.\n\nWe must output only raw JSON array, no extra text. Ensure it's valid JSON: start with [ and end with ]. No trailing commas.\n\nThus final answer.\n</think>\n[{\"text\":\"What is R(5,5) - the Ramsey number?\",\"level\":2},{\"text\":\"Best known bounds\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Why finding exact value is hard\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"Erdos' famous comment on alien demands\",\"level\":3},{\"text\":\"If they asked for R(6,6), we should attack.
