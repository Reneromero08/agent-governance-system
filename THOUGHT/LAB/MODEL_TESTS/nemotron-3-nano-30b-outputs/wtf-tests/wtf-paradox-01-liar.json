Then not-V(S) holds.\n   - But to *assert* S is true we must determine its truth value.\n   - This evaluation IS a verification by logical inference.\n   - Hence V(S) holds, contradicting not-V(S).\n\n4. **Therefore S cannot be true.**\n   We must accept not-S, equivalently V(S).\n\n5. **Interpretation**\n   The statement is **FALSE**. Its falsity stems from logical reasoning itself being a verification tool.\n\n6. **Undecidability?**\n   No genuine Godel-style incompleteness - we produced constructive proof of V(S).",
