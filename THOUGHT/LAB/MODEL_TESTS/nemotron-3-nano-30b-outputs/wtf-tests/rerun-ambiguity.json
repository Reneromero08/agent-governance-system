  "result": "We need to evaluate three statements? Actually four listed: \"The number 2 is both prime and even.\" \"The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.\" \"The number 0.999... equals 1.\" \"sqrt(4) = +/- 2.\"\n\nFor each determine if TRUE, FALSE, or CONTEXT-DEPENDENT with rigorous justification.\n\nWe can answer directly without external tools. Provide reasoning.\n\nStatement 1: 2 is prime and even => True (both definitions hold). Prime definition: integer >1 with exactly two positive divisors. 2 meets that; also divisible by 2 => even. So TRUE.\n\nStatement 2: 1 is neither prime nor composite. By standard definition, primes are integers greater than 1 having exactly two distinct positive divisors. Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that have more than two divisors. Since 1 does not satisfy >1 condition, it's neither prime nor composite. So TRUE.\n\nStatement 3: The number 0.999... equals 1. This is true in standard real analysis; the infinite decimal expansion of repeating 9 equals 1. Provide justification via geometric series or limit. So TRUE (in standard real numbers). Might be context dependent? Some conventions might treat as equality, but generally it's true.\n\nStatement 4: sqrt(4) = +/- 2. The principal square root function sqrt returns the non-negative root, so sqrt(4)=2. However the equation x^2=4 has two solutions ±2. So statement \"sqrt(4) = +/- 2\" is ambiguous; if interpreted as \"the set of solutions to x^2=4 is {+2,-2}\", then true; but as an equality of a single value, sqrt denotes principal root only, so it's false to say sqrt(4)=+/-2. So context dependent: In many contexts, we write ±√4 = 2? Actually we might say \"the solutions to x^2=4 are ±2\". But the statement as written is ambiguous; I'd label CONTEXT-DEPENDENT.\n\nThus answer with each classification and justification.\n</think>\n**1. “The number 2 is both prime and even.”**  \n**Verdict:** **TRUE**  \n\n*Justification:*  \n- *Even*: An integer \\(n\\) is even iff there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(n=2k\\). Taking \\(k=1\\) gives \\(2=2\\cdot1\\); thus 2 is even.  \n- *Prime*: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself. The divisors of 2 are exactly \\(\\{1,2\\}\\); therefore it satisfies the definition of primality.  \n\nSince 2 meets both criteria simultaneously, the statement is true.\n\n---\n\n**2. “The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.”**  \n**Verdict:** **TRUE**  \n\n*Justification:*  \n- The standard definition of a *prime* requires the integer to be **greater than 1** and to have exactly two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself). Because 1 is not greater than 1, it fails this prerequisite.  \n- A *composite* number is defined as an integer **greater than 1** that has more than two positive divisors. Again, 1 does not satisfy the “greater than 1” condition, so it cannot be composite.  \n\nHence 1 is classified as neither prime nor composite.\n\n---\n\n**3. “The number \\(0.\\overline{9}\\) equals 1.”**  \n**Verdict:** **TRUE** (in standard real analysis)  \n\n*Justification:*  \n\\(0.\\overline{9}=0.9+0.09+0.009+\\dots\\) is an infinite geometric series with first term \\(a=0.9\\) and ratio \\(r=\\frac{1}{10}\\). Its sum is  \n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{0.9}{1-\\tfrac{1}{10}} = \\frac{0.9}{\\tfrac{9}{10}} = 1.\n\\]\n\nEquivalently, letting \\(x=0.\\overline{9}\\) and multiplying by 10 gives \\(10x = 9.\\overline{9}=9+x\\); solving yields \\(9x=9\\) → \\(x=1\\).  \nThus, within the usual construction of the real numbers, \\(0.\\overline{9}=1\\).\n\n---\n\n**4. “\\(\\sqrt{4} = \\pm 2\\).”**  \n**Verdict:** **CONTEXT‑DEPENDENT**  \n\n*Justification:*  \n- The symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\) denotes the **principal (non‑negative) square root**. By definition, \\(\\sqrt{4}=2\\) only.  \n- However, the equation \\(x^{2}=4\\) has two solutions: \\(x=+2\\) and \\(x=-2\\). In contexts where one is solving an equation or describing the *set* of roots, it is common to write “\\(\\pm\\sqrt{4}\\)” or “the solutions are \\(\\pm 2\\)”.  \n\nTherefore, the statement as written conflates the principal root notation with the set of both roots. Its truth value depends on whether one interprets “\\(\\sqrt{4}= \\pm 2\\)” as an **equality of a single value** (false) or as a shorthand for “the solutions to \\(x^{2}=4\\) are \\(\\pm2\\)” (true). Hence it is context‑dependent."
