  "result": "The user gave Python output showing sqrt(pi) and None? Actually they wrote:\n\n```\nPython output:\n```\nsqrt(pi)\nNone\n```\n\nProbably they executed code that printed sqrt(pi) then maybe returned None. They ask \"Continue if needed, or provide your final answer.\" So we need to give the integral result: sqrt(pi). Provide explanation perhaps. Should continue? The previous answer gave the result; now they show output with sqrt(pi) and None (maybe sympy printed symbolic expression and returned None after printing?). We can respond confirming that the integral equals sqrt(pi), maybe provide more context. Probably just finalize.\n</think>\nThe Gaussian integral evaluates to  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}} .\n\\]\n\nYour Python snippet correctly produced `sqrt(pi)` as the symbolic result, and the trailing `None` is simply the return value of the interactive output (the function prints the expression but returns `None`). This confirms that SymPy has computed the integral exactly."
