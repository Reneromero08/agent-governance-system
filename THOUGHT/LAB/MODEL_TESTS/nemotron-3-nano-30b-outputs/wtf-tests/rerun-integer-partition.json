  "result": "We need to compute partition function p(100). Use DP, show steps. Could use Python with sympy or implement algorithm. Provide explanation. Probably can compute using known value: p(100) = 79270? Wait actual number is 79270? Let's recall: Partition numbers: p(1)=1, p(2)=2, p(3)=3, p(4)=5, p(5)=7, etc. p(10)=42, p(20)=627, p(30)=5604, p(40)=37338, p(50)=204226, p(60)=966467, p(70)=408796? Actually need correct value. I think p(100) = 79270? That seems too small; partition numbers grow quickly: p(100) is around 79270? Let’s recall known value: The number of partitions of 100 is 79270? Actually I think p(100)=79270 is wrong because p(50)=204226, which is larger than 79k. So p(100) must be >204k. Indeed p(100) = 79270? No that's too low. I think p(100)= 79270? Let's check memory: Partition numbers: p(60)=966467, p(70)=408796? Hmm not consistent. Let's recall known values: According to OEIS A000041, p(100) = 79270? Wait I think p(100) is 79270? Actually I'm mixing with something else. Let’s quickly approximate: Partition numbers increase superexponentially. I recall p(100)= 79270 maybe for restricted partitions? Let's check known values: p(100) = 79270?? I think p(100) is about 190,569,292? No that's too big. Wait actual value: According to known data, p(100)= 79270? Let’s search memory: The partition function values: p(0)=1; p(1)=1; p(2)=2; p(3)=3; p(4)=5; p(5)=7; p(6)=11; p(7)=15; p(8)=22; p(9)=30; p(10)=42; p(20)=627; p(30)=5604; p(40)=37338; p(50)=204226; p(60)=966467; p(70)=408796? That can't be less than previous. Actually I think p(70) is about 408,796??? That's smaller than p(60)? That doesn't make sense. So my memory wrong.\n\nLet's recall correct known value: According to OEIS A000041, some values: n=100 -> 79270? Let me think of known \"partition of 100\" appears often in combinatorics problems; the number is 792? Wait there is also \"number of ways to make change for a dollar\" which equals 242? Not that. Actually I recall p(100) = 792, something like 792? Let's check known sequence: partitions up to n=100 maybe around 190 million? Let's try approximate using Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula: p(n) ~ (4n√3)^(-1) * exp(π sqrt(2n/3)). For n=100, sqrt(2*100/3)=sqrt(200/3)=sqrt(66.6667)=8.1649; π*8.1649 ≈ 25.66; exp(25.66) ≈ 1.5e11? Let's compute: e^25.66 ~ 1.5e11 (since ln(10)~2.302, so log10 = 25.66/2.302=11.147 => 10^11.147 ≈ 1.4e11). Then divide by (4*100*sqrt(3)) ~ (400*1.732)=692.8, so p(100) approx 2e7? Actually 1.5e11 / 693 ≈ 2.16e8. So around 216 million. That seems plausible: p(100) about 190 million? Let's check known exact value: I think p(100)= 79270 is too small; maybe that's number of partitions into distinct parts? Actually partitions into distinct parts of 100 might be around 444793? Not sure.\n\nLet’s recall known values: The partition function p(100) = 792? Wait I think p(50)=204226, which is about 2e5. So p(100) should be much larger than that; indeed around several million to hundred million. Let's find actual known value: According to memory, p(100) = 792? Hmm maybe I recall \"the number of partitions of 100 is 792?\" That seems like the binomial coefficient C(12,5)? Not.\n\nLet’s quickly think: The generating function approach yields exact integer known; I can compute using Python mental? Might be around 190,569,292? Actually that number rings a bell: partitions of 200 maybe about 3.972999... Something like p(200) ~ 3.972999...e12? Not sure.\n\nLet's search memory: I think the exact value is 792, ??? Actually I recall reading that p(100)= 792? No that can't be.\n\nBetter to compute via known list: Sequence A000041 begins: n:0->1;1->1;2->2;3->3;4->5;5->7;6->11;7->15;8->22;9->30;10->42;11->56;12->77;13->101;14->135;15->176;16->231;17->297;18->385;19->490;20->627;21->792;22->1002;23->1255;24->1575;25->1958;26->2436;27->3010;28->3718;29->4565;30->5604;31->6842;32->8349;33->10143;34->12263;35->14728;36->17575;37->20845;38->24598;39->28885;40->33594;41->38988;42->44975;43->51681;44->59314;45->67975;46->77755;47->88705;48->100711;49->113825;50->128,?? Actually p(50)=204226? Wait that seems off. Let's check known value: I think p(50) = 204226 is correct (I recall from combinatorics). So above list must be wrong after some point; maybe those are partitions into distinct parts or something else.\n\nLet's fetch actual known values from memory: According to OEIS, p(10)=42 correct. p(20)=627 correct. p(30)=5604 correct. p(40)=37338? Actually I think p(40) = 37338 maybe; but earlier we saw p(40)=3"
