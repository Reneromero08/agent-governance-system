The user asked \"Search the web.\" We used fetch_url? Actually we used a tool? In previous turn we responded with JSON for fetching Wikipedia page. Now tool output gave article content. So we should answer directly: Satya Nadella.\n\nWe need to produce final answer. Probably just state name.\n</think>\nThe current CEO of Microsoft is **Satya Nadella**."
