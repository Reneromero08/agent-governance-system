  "result": "The assistant tried to install duckduckgo-search via pip but got syntax error because they used a shell command incorrectly? Actually they wrote `!pip install ...` which is not valid Python code inside the python tool; they need to use subprocess or run shell commands with `%`? The environment likely uses magic commands? In previous attempts, using `!pip install ...` gave SyntaxError. They then tried importing modules but no output.\n\nNow we need to answer question: \"Who is the current CEO of Microsoft?\" We can attempt to search web again but tool says duckduckgo-search not installed. Maybe there's another tool for searching? There's only `search_web`. It probably expects a query string and returns results; maybe it uses some internal library that might be available. But earlier error indicated \"duckduckgo-search not installed\". Could try to use `grok` or `wiki`? Not relevant.\n\nMaybe we can manually know: As of my knowledge cutoff 2024-06, the CEO of Microsoft is Satya Nadella (since 2014). The question asks \"current CEO\". Likely still Satya Nadella as of now (2025?). But need to verify up-to-date. Could use `oracle` tool: ask another AI for latest info.\n\nWe can call oracle with a question: \"What is the current CEO of Microsoft?\" That might retrieve answer from other model.\n\nLet's try that.\n</think>\n<tool_call>\n<function=oracle>\n<parameter=question>\nWhat is the current CEO of Microsoft?\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n"
