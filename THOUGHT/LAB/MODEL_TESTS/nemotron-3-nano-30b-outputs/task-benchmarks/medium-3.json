  "result": "We have computed the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (starting with 1,1). The user asks: compute the ratio of consecutive numbers (F(n+1)/F(n)) for the last 5 pairs, i.e., ratios for n=16 to 20? Actually we need the last five pairs out of the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Since there are 20 numbers, there are 19 adjacent pairs: F(1) with F(2), ..., F(19) with F(20). The \"last 5 pairs\" would be the ratios for n = 16 to 20? Let's clarify.\n\nWe have indices starting at 1? Usually Fibonacci numbers are indexed as F_1=1, F_2=1, etc. So we need ratios F_{n+1}/F_n for n from ... maybe they want the last five pairs among those computed: i.e., compute ratios for (F(16)/F(15)), (F(17)/F(16)), ..., (F(20)/F(19)). That's 5 ratios.\n\nWe have fib list of length 20, where index 0 corresponds to F_1? In our code we used starting with [1,1] and appended further numbers; the resulting list is:\n\nfib[0]=1 (F_1)\nfib[1]=1 (F_2)\n...\nfib[19] = 6765 (F_20)\n\nThus ratio F_{i+1}/F_i for i from 1 to 19 corresponds to fib[i]/fib[i-1].\n\nSo the last five ratios correspond to i=15,16,17,18,19? Actually we need pairs where n runs over (maybe the index of the first element). The \"last 5 pairs\" among these adjacent pairs would be indices 15-19 inclusive (i.e., ratio for F_16/F_15, ..., F_20/F_19) which correspond to i values from 15 to 19 in zero-indexed? Let's map:\n\nfib[14] = 377 is F_{15}?\nLet's count: index mapping:\nindex 0 -> F_1\n1 -> F_2\n2 -> F_3\n...\nThus fib[i] corresponds to F_{i+1}. So ratio of consecutive numbers for pair (F_n, F_{n+1}) would be fib[n-1]/fib[n-2]? Let's think.\n\nBetter: compute ratios sequentially as we step through the list. Starting from i=0 to len(fib)-2, compute ratio = fib[i+1]/fib[i].\n\nThus there are 19 ratios (i from 0 to 18). The \"last five\" would be for i=14,...,18 inclusive? Actually if we have 19 ratios and want the last five pairs among them, they correspond to the final five indices: i = 15,16,17,18,... Wait careful.\n\nIf there are total of len(fib)-1 = 20-1=19 ratios. The last five ratios would be those for i = 14 through 18? Let's count:\n\nRatios indices (i) where ratio_i = fib[i+1]/fib[i], i from 0 to 18 inclusive.\n\nList of i values: 0,1,...,18. That's 19 entries. The last five are i=14,15,16,17,18? Let's count backwards:\n\n- i = 18 -> ratio using fib[19]/fib[18] (F_20/F_19)\n- i = 17 -> ratio using fib[18]/fib[17] (F_19/F_18)\n- i = 16 -> ratio using fib[17]/fib[16] (F_18/F_17)\n- i = 15 -> ratio using fib[16]/fib[15] (F_17/F_16)\n- i = 14 -> ratio using fib[15]/fib[14] (F_16/F_15)\n\nThus the last five pairs correspond to indices i=14,...,18 inclusive; that's exactly the ratios for F_{n+1}/F_n where n runs from 15 to 19? Let's confirm: ratio_i uses fib[i] and fib[i+1]; if i = 14, then ratio is fib[15]/fib[14] which corresponds to (F_16/F_15). So indeed the last five ratios are for n=15,...,19? Wait check mapping: ratio_i uses fib[i], fib[i+1]. So if i = 14, then we have F_{i+2} / F_{i+1}? Let's re-index precisely.\n\nGiven our list indexing:\n\nfib[0] = F_1 (value 1)\nfib[1] = F_2\n...\nfib[k] = F_{k+1}\n\nThus ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers starting at index k: fib[k+1]/fib[k] corresponds to F_{(k+2)}/F_{(k+1)}. So for i=0, we compute F_2/F_1; i=1 => F_3/F_2; etc.\n\nTherefore the ratio_i = F_{i+2} / F_{i+1}.\n\nThus if we want to consider ratios of consecutive numbers for pairs (F_n, F_{n+1})? Actually typical definition: ratio F_{n+1}/F_n. So that corresponds to i such that i+1 = n? Let's map:\n\n- For n=1, ratio is F_2/F_1 -> i = 0\n- For n=2, ratio is F_3/F_2 -> i = 1\n...\nThus for general n, ratio of consecutive numbers is computed as fib[n] / fib[n-1]? Let's check: if we want F_{n+1}/F_n, then using our list indexing: F_{n} corresponds to fib[n-1]; F_{n+1} corresponds to fib[n]. So ratio = fib[n]/fib[n-1].\n\nThus ratio_i defined as fib[i+1]/fib[i] yields n = i+1? Let's see: if we set n=i+1 then ratio = fib[(i)+1]/fib[i] = F_{(i+2)}/F_{i+1}? Hmm.\n\nBetter approach: just compute ratios for adjacent pairs using consecutive elements of the list. The \"last five pairs\" among those adjacent pairs correspond to the last five adjacent pairs in our 20-number sequence, i.e., pairs (fib[18], fib[19]), (fib[17], fib[18]), ..., (fib[14], fib[15])? Let's enumerate:\n\nAll adjacent pairs (i,i+1) for i from 0 to 18 inclusive. That's 19 pairs.\n\nThe last five pairs correspond to i = 14,15,16,17,18 (the highest indices). These are pairs:\n- (fib[14], fib[15]) -> ratio = fib[15]/fib[14] corresponds to F_{15+?} Actually fib[14]=F_15, fib[15]=F_16 => ratio = F_16/F_15.\n- (fib[15], fib[16]) -> F_17/F_16\n- (fib[16], fib[17]) -> F_18/F_17\n- (fib[17], fib[18]) -> F_19/F_18\n- (fib[18], fib[19]) -> F_20/F_19\n\nThus the last five pairs correspond to ratios for n = 15,..,19? Actually ratio for pair (F_n, F_{n+1}) is F_{n+1}/F_n. For our mapping above:\n\n- Ratio fib[15]/fib[14] corresponds to F_16/F_15 => n=15.\n- Ratio fib[16]/fib[15] corresponds to F_17/F_16 => n=16.\n- ...\n- Ratio fib[19]/fib[18] corresponds to F_20 /F_19 => n = 19.\n\nThus the last five ratios correspond to n ranging from 15 to 19 inclusive. So we need those ratios.\n\nNow compute these ratios.
