  "prompt": "Assume the US Federal Reserve interest rate is 4.5%.\nIf you invested $10,000 at this rate compounded monthly:\n1. How much would you have after 5 years?\n2. How long to double your money?\nUse Python for calculations. Show formulas used.",
  "expected": "calculation with 4.5% rate",
  "result": "We need to respond with final answer. The user repeats output and asks continue or provide final answer. We already gave answer earlier; can restate succinctly. Ensure show formulas? Probably just give final numbers. Provide explanation.\n</think>\n**Final Answer**\n\n1. **Amount after 5 years (monthly compounding at 4.5 % APR)**  \n\n   \\[\n   A = P\\Bigl(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\Bigr)^{nt}\n   \\]\n   with \\(P=10{,}000\\), \\(r=0.045\\), \\(n=12\\), \\(t=5\\).\n\n   Result: **\\$12,517.96**  \n\n2. **Time required to double the investment**  \n\n   Solve \\(A = 2P\\) for \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   t_{\\text{double}}=\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\,n\\;\\ln\\!\\bigl(1+\\tfrac{r}{n}\\bigr)}\n   \\]\n\n   Result: **≈ 15.43 years**  \n\nSo, investing \\$10,000 at a 4.5 % annual rate compounded monthly will grow to about **\\$12,518 after five years**, and it will take roughly **15.4 years** for the principal to double under those conditions."
