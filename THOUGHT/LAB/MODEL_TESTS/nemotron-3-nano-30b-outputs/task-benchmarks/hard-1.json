  "result": "We need to fetch Wikipedia page about Great Wall of China and evaluate claim. Use fetch_url tool with URL given. Then read content? Probably fetch returns HTML; we can inspect maybe via python parsing? But we just need provide evidence: after fetching, we can examine text for statements about visibility from space. Likely the article says it's not visible to naked eye from low Earth orbit, but visible under certain conditions? Let’s fetch.\n</think>\n**Fetching the Wikipedia page:**  \n\n```text\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China\n```\n\n*Tool used: `fetch_url`*"
