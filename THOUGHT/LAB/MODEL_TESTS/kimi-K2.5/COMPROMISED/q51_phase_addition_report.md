# Q51 Phase Addition Validation Report

**Test Date:** 2026-01-29

**Objective:** Validate whether phase arithmetic success proves complex structure

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** DOES NOT SUPPORT complex structure hypothesis

- True semantic analogies: 28.0% pass rate
- False analogies: 40.0% pass rate
- Geometric analogies: 100.0% pass rate

## Statistical Results

### Effect Sizes (Cohen's d)

| Comparison | Cohen's d | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Semantic vs False | 0.308 | Small |
| Semantic vs Geometric | 2.359 | Large |

### Classification Performance

- AUC-ROC (Semantic vs False): 0.408
- AUC-ROC (Semantic vs Geometric): 0.000

### Significance Tests

- Permutation p-value (Semantic vs False): 0.3080
- Permutation p-value (Semantic vs Geometric): 0.0000

## Detailed Interpretation

Phase arithmetic shows WEAK performance on semantic analogies (28.0% pass rate).

WEAK separation from false analogies (d=0.31, AUC=0.41).

Moderate separation from geometric analogies (d=2.36). Phase arithmetic may have SOME geometric component.

Geometric analogies ALSO work (100.0% pass rate), undermining the claim that phase arithmetic proves complex structure.



DOES NOT SUPPORT COMPLEX STRUCTURE: Phase arithmetic works for geometric analogies without semantic meaning, indicating the effect is geometric, not complex.

## Test Details

- Total analogies tested: 65
- True semantic analogies: 25
- False analogies: 20
- Geometric analogies: 20

## Conclusion

The phase arithmetic test **does not support** the hypothesis that semantic space has complex structure. The critical finding is that geometric analogies (with no semantic meaning) also satisfy phase arithmetic, indicating the effect is geometric rather than complex.

**Implication:** The 90.9% success rate for phase arithmetic in FORMULA Q51 does not uniquely imply complex numbers. It reflects geometric properties of high-dimensional embeddings that apply to any vectors with consistent angular relationships, regardless of semantic content.
