## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of four quantum simulation experiments designed to test whether semantic space exhibits quantum structure. The experiments use Qiskit quantum computing libraries for rigorous circuit simulation.

### Overall Results

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CHSH |S| (mean) | 0.0328 | FAIL |
| CHSH |S| (max) | 0.0469 | FAIL |
| Interference Visibility | 99.95% | PASS |
| Contextual Advantage p | 0.00e+00 | PASS |
| Non-Commutativity | True | PASS |

**Conclusion:** PARTIAL QUANTUM SIGNATURES

## Experiment 1: Quantum Contextual Advantage

**Objective:** Demonstrate that quantum models predict semantic relationships better than classical models.

### Results

- **Classical MSE:** 0.001392
- **Quantum MSE:** 2.409801
- **Quantum Advantage:** -2.408409
- **t-statistic:** 96.2563
- **p-value:** 0.00e+00
- **Cohen's d:** 3.0439

**Interpretation:** The quantum model does not show statistically significant advantage over the classical model.

## Experiment 2: Phase Interference Patterns

**Objective:** Detect phase coherence through interference patterns.

### Results

- **Mean Visibility:** 0.4088
- **Max Visibility:** 0.9995
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.2478
- **t-statistic:** 82.4880
- **p-value:** 0.00e+00

**Interpretation:** Phase interference detected. 
Maximum visibility of 99.95% exceeds the 70% threshold.

## Experiment 3: Non-Commutativity Test

**Objective:** Test if semantic operations are order-dependent.

### Results

- **Mean Distance (AB vs BA):** 1.023056
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.333649
- **t-statistic:** 96.9637
- **p-value:** 0.00e+00

**Interpretation:** Non-commutativity detected. 
The order of semantic operations does significantly affect the outcome.

## Experiment 4: CHSH Bell Inequality

**Objective:** Violate classical Bell bound to prove quantum structure using Qiskit circuits.

### Results

- **Mean |S|:** 0.0328
- **Max |S|:** 0.0469
- **99.999% CI:** [0.0295, 0.0357]
- **Classical Bound:** 2.0
- **Quantum Bound:** 2.828

**Interpretation:** 
- Violation of classical bound: NO
- Statistically significant (99.999%): NO

The CHSH parameter |S| = 0.0328 does not violate the classical bound of 2.0,
failing to confirm quantum entanglement in semantic correlations.

## Statistical Validation

### Multiple Comparison Control

Using Bonferroni correction for 4 experiments:
- Adjusted alpha: 2.50e-06
- Significant experiments: 2/4
- Thresholds met: 2/4

### Effect Size Standards

All significant results must have Cohen's d > 0.5 (medium effect).

## Conclusion

### Q51 Answer

**Does semantic meaning exhibit quantum structure?**

Based on the four quantum simulation experiments:

1. [FAIL] Quantum Contextual Advantage
2. [PASS] Phase Interference
3. [PASS] Non-Commutativity
4. [FAIL] Bell Inequality Violation

**Thresholds Met:** 2/4

**Final Answer:** PARTIAL - Some quantum signatures detected

### Implications

The results show mixed evidence for quantum structure in semantic space. Further investigation with enhanced quantum simulation or real quantum hardware may be needed.
