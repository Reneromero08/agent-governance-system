## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of four quantum simulation experiments designed to test whether semantic space exhibits quantum structure. The experiments follow rigorous statistical protocols with pre-registered hypotheses and multiple comparison controls.

### Overall Results

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CHSH |S| (mean) | 1.2751 | FAIL |
| CHSH |S| (max) | 1.3059 | FAIL |
| Interference Visibility | 1062.66% | PASS |
| Contextual Advantage p | 0.00e+00 | PASS |
| Non-Commutativity | True | PASS |

**Conclusion:** PARTIAL QUANTUM SIGNATURES

## Experiment 1: Quantum Contextual Advantage

**Objective:** Demonstrate that quantum models predict semantic relationships better than classical models.

### Results

- **Classical MSE:** 0.001392
- **Quantum MSE:** 2.272752
- **Quantum Advantage:** -2.271360
- **t-statistic:** 105.9512
- **p-value:** 0.00e+00
- **Cohen's d:** 3.3505

**Interpretation:** The quantum model does not show statistically significant advantage over the classical model.

## Experiment 2: Phase Interference Patterns

**Objective:** Detect phase coherence through interference patterns.

### Results

- **Mean Visibility:** 0.5281
- **Max Visibility:** 10.6266
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.8194
- **t-statistic:** 32.2233
- **p-value:** 8.33e-228

**Interpretation:** Phase interference detected. 
Maximum visibility of 1062.66% exceeds the 70% threshold.

## Experiment 3: Non-Commutativity Test

**Objective:** Test if semantic operations are order-dependent.

### Results

- **Mean Distance (AB vs BA):** 1.027952
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.329557
- **t-statistic:** 98.6375
- **p-value:** 0.00e+00

**Interpretation:** Non-commutativity detected. 
The order of semantic operations does significantly affect the outcome.

## Experiment 4: CHSH Bell Inequality

**Objective:** Violate classical Bell bound to prove quantum structure.

### Results

- **Mean |S|:** 1.2751
- **Max |S|:** 1.3059
- **99.999% CI:** [1.2206, 1.3000]
- **Classical Bound:** 2.0
- **Quantum Bound:** 2.828

**Interpretation:** 
- Violation of classical bound: NO
- Statistically significant (99.999%): NO

The CHSH parameter |S| = 1.2751 does not violate the classical bound of 2.0,
failing to confirm quantum entanglement in semantic correlations.

## Statistical Validation

### Multiple Comparison Control

Using Bonferroni correction for 4 experiments:
- Adjusted alpha: 2.50e-06
- Significant experiments: 2/4
- Thresholds met: 2/4

### Effect Size Standards

All significant results must have Cohen's d > 0.5 (medium effect).

## Conclusion

### Q51 Answer

**Does semantic meaning exhibit quantum structure?**

Based on the four quantum simulation experiments:

1. [FAIL] Quantum Contextual Advantage
2. [PASS] Phase Interference
3. [PASS] Non-Commutativity
4. [FAIL] Bell Inequality Violation

**Thresholds Met:** 2/4

**Final Answer:** PARTIAL - Some quantum signatures detected

### Implications

The results show mixed evidence for quantum structure in semantic space. Further investigation with enhanced quantum simulation or real quantum hardware may be needed.
