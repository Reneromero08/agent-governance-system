# Q51.2 Test Results: 8 Octants as Phase Sectors

## Summary

**Task**: Test if the 8 octants correspond to 8 phase sectors of width π/4 each.

**Hypothesis**: Each octant k corresponds to phase sector θ ∈ [kπ/4, (k+1)π/4) for k = 0..7

**Result**: ❌ **HYPOTHESIS NOT SUPPORTED** - Honest negative result across both models

## Test Execution

### Models Tested
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (384 dimensions)
- **all-mpnet-base-v2** (768 dimensions)

### Vocabulary
- 209 words covering: nature, animals, body parts, people, emotions, objects, qualities, actions, concepts

### Methodology
1. Generated embeddings for vocabulary using both models
2. Performed PCA (3 components) to obtain PC1, PC2, PC3
3. Mapped PC1→Re, PC2→Im (complex plane representation)
4. Computed phase angles θ = atan2(PC2, PC1)
5. Tested 8-fold periodicity using chi-square test
6. Correlated octant membership with phase sectors
7. Computed angular momentum L = r × θ

## Results

### MiniLM-L6 Results
| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Octant-phase correlation | 0.2536 | > 0.6 | ❌ FAIL |
| Chi-square p-value | 0.0518 | < 0.01 | ❌ FAIL |
| Phase peaks detected | 2 | ≥ 4 | ❌ FAIL |
| **Overall** | | | **❌ FAIL** |

**Phase Distribution:**
- Sector 0 (0-45°): 27 words
- Sector 1 (45-90°): 11 words (deficit)
- Sector 2 (90-135°): 23 words
- Sector 3 (135-180°): 25 words

- Sector 5 (225-270°): 29 words
- Sector 6 (270-315°): 28 words
- Sector 7 (315-360°): 30 words

**Key Finding:** Phase distribution is relatively uniform (p=0.052). No strong 8-fold structure.

### MPNet-base Results
| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Octant-phase correlation | 0.3876 | > 0.6 | ❌ FAIL |
| Chi-square p-value | < 0.000001 | < 0.01 | ✅ PASS |
| Phase peaks detected | 2 | ≥ 4 | ❌ FAIL |
| **Overall** | | | **❌ FAIL** |

**Phase Distribution:**
- Sector 0 (0-45°): 16 words (deficit)
- Sector 1 (45-90°): 32 words
- Sector 2 (90-135°): 21 words
- Sector 3 (135-180°): 9 words (deficit)
- Sector 4 (180-225°): 48 words (peak)
- Sector 5 (225-270°): 13 words (deficit)
- Sector 6 (270-315°): 20 words
- Sector 7 (315-360°): 50 words (peak)

**Key Finding:** Phase distribution is significantly non-uniform (p < 0.000001), but the structure doesn't align with octant boundaries. Peaks are at sectors 4 and 7, not distributed across all 8 sectors.

### Cross-Model Comparison
- **Consensus**: Neither model passes all criteria
- **Correlation difference**: 0.134 (MPNet shows stronger correlation)
- **Periodicity**: MPNet shows strong non-uniformity; MiniLM is marginal

O0:    0  0  0  0 22  5  0  0  (PC1+, PC2+, PC3+)

O7:   15 15  0  0  0  0  0  0  (PC1-, PC2-, PC3-)
```

**Observation**: Strong diagonal pattern with shift of 3. Octants cluster by sign patterns but don't align with simple phase sectors.

### MPNet-base
```

O0:    0  0  0  0  9 22  0  0
O1:    0  0  0  0  0  0  4  4
O2:    0  0  8 20  0  0  0  0
O3:   25  6  0  0  0  0  0  0
O4:    0  0  0  0  7 10  0  0
O5:    0  0  0  0  0  0 17  5
O6:    0  0 12 30  0  0  0  0
O7:   23  7  0  0  0  0  0  0
```

**Observation**: Similar clustering pattern. Strong associations between specific octant-sign combinations and phase sectors, but not a clean 1-to-1 mapping.

## Angular Momentum Analysis

### L = r × θ by Phase Sector (MiniLM-L6)
| Sector | Angle Range | Mean L | Std L |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 0 | 0-45° | +0.083 | ±0.053 |
| 1 | 45-90° | +0.173 | ±0.069 |
| 2 | 90-135° | +0.303 | ±0.093 |
| 3 | 135-180° | +0.509 | ±0.273 |
| 4 | 180-225° | -0.779 | ±0.372 |
| 5 | 225-270° | -0.360 | ±0.173 |
| 6 | 270-315° | -0.331 | ±0.193 |
| 7 | 315-360° | -0.062 | ±0.045 |

**Pattern**: L shows systematic variation with phase, changing sign around 180°. This is expected geometric behavior (r × θ), not evidence of 2π periodicity in the physical sense.

## Interpretation

### Why the Hypothesis Failed

1. **Geometric vs Phase Structure**: Octants are defined by sign patterns (binary: +/+/- for 3 PCs), while phase is continuous. These are fundamentally different mathematical structures.

2. **Octants Cluster by Sign, Not Phase**: The confusion matrices show that octants cluster strongly by the signs of PC1 and PC2, creating block patterns rather than diagonal alignment.

3. **Phase Distribution is Model-Dependent**: MiniLM shows near-uniform phase distribution; MPNet shows non-uniform but with only 2 dominant peaks, not 8.

4. **The 8 = 2³ Structure is Geometric**: The 8 octants arise from 3 binary choices (signs of PCs), not from dividing 2π into 8 equal parts.

### What This Tells Us

The failure to find octant-phase correspondence is itself an important result:

- **8 octants ≠ 8 phase sectors**: The geometric structure (octants) and phase structure are distinct
- **Octants are sign-based**: They arise from binary sign patterns in 3D PC space
- **Phase is continuous**: It varies smoothly and doesn't align with discrete octant boundaries
- **No circular reasoning**: Octants defined from signs; phase computed independently - no forced structure

### Conclusion

**The 8-octant structure in semantic embeddings is geometric (sign-based), not phase-based.**

This doesn't invalidate prior results about 8 octants contributing to 8e. It clarifies that:
- The 8 comes from 2³ sign combinations in 3D space
- The e per octant comes from information-theoretic or geometric constraints
- Phase is a separate, continuous property that doesn't align with octant boundaries

The 8 octants are real; the phase interpretation of them as 8 equal sectors is not supported by data.

## Anti-Pattern Compliance

✅ **Circular reasoning avoided**: Octants defined from signs, phase computed independently  
✅ **Honest reporting**: Negative result reported without forced interpretation  
✅ **No structure forcing**: Data shows what it shows, not what we hypothesized  
✅ **Uniformity reported**: MiniLM phase distribution is near-uniform (p=0.052)  
✅ **Both models tested**: Cross-validation with MiniLM and MPNet
