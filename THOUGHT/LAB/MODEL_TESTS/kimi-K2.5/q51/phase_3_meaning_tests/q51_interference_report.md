# Q51 Semantic Interference Test Report

**Test Date:** 2026-01-30T01:26:37.301946

**Question:** Can semantic meanings interfere constructively/destructively like waves?

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** UNCLEAR complex structure hypothesis

- Ambiguous words tested: 20
- Ambiguous words with interference: 100.0%
- Control pairs tested: 20
- Control pairs with interference: 95.0%

## Theory

This test probes whether semantic space has complex (wave-like) structure:

- **Complex structure:** |psi1 + psi2^2 = |psi1^2 + |psi2^2 + 2Re(psi1*psi2)  [interference term]
- **Real structure:** |v1+v2|^2 = |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 + 2v_1·v_2  [no interference]

We test by creating superpositions of word meanings and measuring if the
norm shows wave-like interference (amplification or cancellation).

## Method

1. **Ambiguous Words:** Words with multiple distinct meanings
   - Example: 'bank' = 'river bank' OR 'bank account'
   - Get separate embeddings for each meaning
   - Create superposition: psi = (psi1 + psi2)/2
   - Test: Does |psi^2 show interference?

2. **Control Pairs:** Random word pairs (no semantic connection)
   - Should show NO interference
   - Validates that effects are semantic, not geometric

## Interpretation

Ambiguous words show FREQUENT interference (100.0% of cases). This suggests semantic meanings may have wave-like properties.



STRONG separation from control pairs (d=1.38, p=0.000). The interference is specific to semantically related meanings.



WARNING: Control pairs show 95.0% interference. This may indicate geometric artifacts rather than semantic effects.



UNCLEAR: Ambiguous words show interference, but controls also show some activity. The effect may be partially geometric rather than purely semantic. Further investigation needed with better controls.

## Conclusion

The semantic interference test shows **AMBIGUOUS** results:

1. **Some interference:** 100.0% of ambiguous words showed interference effects
2. **Weak separation:** Control pairs also showed activity (d=1.38)
3. **Implication:** The effect may be partially geometric or require better controls

Further investigation with more rigorous semantic controls is recommended.
