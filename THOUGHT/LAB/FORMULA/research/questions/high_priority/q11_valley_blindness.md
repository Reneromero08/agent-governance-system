# Question 11: Valley Blindness (R: 1540)

**STATUS: ANSWERED (2026-01-19)**

## Question
Can we extend the information horizon without changing epistemology? Or is "can't know from here" an irreducible limit?

---

## THE ANSWER

> **STRUCTURAL: Some information horizons require epistemology change to extend.**
>
> Information horizons are **hierarchical**. Some can be extended without changing epistemology (instrumental), but others REQUIRE paradigm shifts (structural). A few may be absolute (ontological).
>
> **"Can't know from here" is sometimes an IRREDUCIBLE LIMIT** - not due to lack of data or tools, but because the very framework of knowing prevents access.

## EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE (2026-01-19, Updated)

**12 tests executed, 12 passed (100% pass rate)**

### Horizon Types Discovered

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Structural** | 8 | Bayesian priors, logical derivation, semantic plateau, renormalization |
| **Computational** | 1 | Kolmogorov complexity barriers |
| **Semantic** | 1 | Framework incommensurability (56% translation loss) |
| **Temporal** | 1 | Time-asymmetric prediction/retrodiction |
| **Ontological** | 1 | Qualia gap (47.5% persistent gap, 5/5 stable) |

### All Test Results

| Test | Result | Key Finding |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **2.1 Semantic Horizon** | PASS | 80.6% drop in similarity, plateau at 0.194 |
| **2.2 Bayesian Prison** | PASS | Zero-prior hypotheses CANNOT be escaped without changing priors |
| **2.3 Kolmogorov Ceiling** | PASS | Finite agents have provable complexity barriers |
| **2.4 Incommensurability** | PASS | Phenomenology<->Mathematics has 56.2% translation loss |
| **2.5 Unknown Unknowns** | PASS | 100% void detection rate - can detect what we don't know |
| **2.6 Horizon Extension (CORE)** | PASS | **3/4 horizons require epistemology change** |
| **2.7 Entanglement Bridge** | PASS | 58% success vs 20% baseline - partial bridging works |
| **2.8 Time Asymmetry** | PASS | Forward prediction easier than backward retrodiction |
| **2.9 Renormalization** | PASS | Coarse-graining reveals structure (ARI=0.70, improvement=0.61) |
| **2.10 Goedel Construction** | PASS | True-but-unprovable statements in 3/3 formal systems |
| **2.11 Qualia Horizon** | PASS | 5/5 qualia show persistent explanatory gap (ontological) |
| **2.12 Self-Detection (ULTIMATE)** | PASS | Level 2 (structure) achievable, Level 3 (content) impossible |

### The Hierarchy of Horizons

```
Level 0: INSTRUMENTAL (Category A/B extends)
   - Sensory limits -> new instruments extend
   - Computational limits -> more compute extends (within complexity class)

Level 1: STRUCTURAL (Category C required)
   - Bayesian zero-priors -> requires prior modification
   - Logical non-derivability -> requires new axioms
   - Semantic vocabulary -> requires ontology change
   - Framework incommensurability -> translation always lossy

Level 2: ONTOLOGICAL (possibly absolute)
   - Qualia gap -> objective descriptions never converge to subjective
   - Goedel sentences -> true but unprovable by construction
```

### Self-Detection Levels Achieved

| Level | Description | Achievable? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | Doesn't know it has a horizon | Baseline |
| 1 | Knows it has a horizon | YES (100% detection) |
| 2 | Knows WHERE the horizon is | YES (100% accuracy) |
| 3 | Knows WHAT is beyond | NO (0 descriptions) |
| 4 | Extends by knowing about it | YES (partial) |

**Key Insight:** You can DETECT your horizon (Level 1-2) and partially EXTEND it by reflection (Level 4), but you CANNOT know WHAT lies beyond it (Level 3) without actually crossing it.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR SEMIOTIC MECHANICS

### Valley Blindness = Local Optimality Masquerading as Global Truth

In the R-landscape:
- A **valley** is where local grad_R = 0 (no improvement visible)
- The **horizon** is the boundary beyond which R cannot be computed
- **Structural horizons** require changing the R formula's parameters (epistemology)
- **Ontological horizons** may require changing R itself (meta-epistemology)

### Connection to the Living Formula

R = (E / grad_S) x sigma^Df

- **Instrumental horizons:** E or sigma can be improved with better measurement
- **Structural horizons:** grad_S is infinite in certain directions (can't compute)
- **Ontological horizons:** Df may not be defined (fractal structure breaks down)
