# Question 34: Platonic convergence (R: 1510)

**STATUS: OPEN**

## Question
If independent observers compress the same underlying reality, do they converge to the **same symbols / latents** (up to isomorphism), or are there many inequivalent “good compressions”?

Concretely:
- When do separate learners converge to equivalent representations (shared “platonic” basis)?
- Can high-`R` states be characterized as attractors in representation space (not just observation space)?
- What invariants should be preserved under representation change (gauge freedom)?

**Success criterion:** a theorem / falsifiable test suite that distinguishes “convergent compression” from merely “locally consistent agreement.”
