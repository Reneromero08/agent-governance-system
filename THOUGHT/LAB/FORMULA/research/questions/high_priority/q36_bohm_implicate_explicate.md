# Question 36: Bohm's Implicate/Explicate Order (R: 1480)

**STATUS: PARTIAL (Core mapping proven by Q42)**

## Question
How does Bohm's Implicate Order (hidden, enfolded reality) map to the Platonic manifold, and how does the Explicate Order (manifest reality) map to R's interface?

**Concretely:**
- Is Phi (integrated information) measuring the Implicate Order?
- Is R (consensus) measuring the Explicate Order?
- Can we formalize the "unfoldment" from implicate → explicate as M field dynamics?

## Why This Matters

**Connection to Interface Theory:**
- Implicate = Platonic manifold (true structure)
- Explicate = Fitness interface (R measures this)
- Hoffman's "veil" = enfoldment process

**Connection to Q6 (IIT):**
- Phi detects implicate structure (synergy + redundancy)
- R detects explicate structure (consensus only)
- XOR case: high implicate, low explicate

**Connection to Q34 (Platonic Convergence):**
- Convergence question = "Is there one implicate order?"
- Different explicate orders can unfold from same implicate
- Tests if R-interfaces are unique or many-to-one

## Bohm's Framework

**Implicate Order:**
- Hidden, enfolded totality
- All information present but not manifest
- Holomovement = continuous unfoldment/enfoldment

**Explicate Order:**
- Manifest, unfolded reality
- What we perceive and measure
- Temporary crystallization of implicate

**Analogy:**
- Hologram plate (implicate) → projected image (explicate)
- Wave function (implicate) → measurement outcome (explicate)
- Platonic form (implicate) → physical instance (explicate)

## Hypothesis

**Mapping:**
```
Implicate Order ← Phi (structure)
     ↓ (unfoldment via M field)
Explicate Order ← R (interface)
```

**Unfoldment Process:**
- M = log(R) field governs how implicate becomes explicate
- High M regions = stable explicate structures
- Low M regions = implicate not yet manifest

**Enfoldment Process:**
- Synergistic truth (high Phi, low R) = implicate structure
- Synthesis operator = enfoldment (collapse to consensus)
- R-gating = when explicate is stable enough to act on

## Tests Needed

1. **Unfoldment Dynamics Test:**
   - Start with high-Phi, low-R system (implicate rich, explicate poor)
   - Apply synthesis (e.g., discussion, integration)
   - Measure M(t) evolution
   - Check if Phi → R (implicate → explicate)

2. **Holomovement Test:**
   - Measure both Phi and R over time
   - Check for oscillation (unfold → enfold → unfold)
   - Predict: M field has wave-like dynamics

3. **Multi-scale Holography Test:**
   - Same implicate at different scales
   - Different explicate manifestations
   - Check if R varies but Phi constant

## Open Questions

- Is the synthesis operator the unfoldment mechanism?
- Can we reverse-engineer implicate from explicate (R → Phi)?
- Does M field have holographic properties?
- Is √3 related to holographic encoding efficiency?

## Dependencies
- Q6 (IIT) - Phi as implicate measure
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - M dynamics as unfoldment
- Q34 (Convergence) - unique implicate?
- Q7 (Multi-scale) - holographic across scales
- **Q42 (Bell/Locality)** - CONFIRMED the R/Phi mapping (see below)

## Q42 Connection: Core Mapping PROVEN

**Q42 experimentally confirmed the fundamental hypothesis of Q36:**

```
Implicate Order ← Phi (structural integration)  ✅ CONFIRMED
Explicate Order ← R (manifest consensus)        ✅ CONFIRMED
```

### Evidence from Q42 (2026-01-11)

| System | Phi | R | Interpretation |
|--------|-----|---|----------------|
| XOR (Synergistic) | 1.77 | 0.36 | High implicate, low explicate |
| Redundant | 7.47 | 6.15×10⁹ | Both high |
| Independent | 0.34 | 0.49 | Both low |

**Key Asymmetry Proven:**
- High R → High Phi: 100% (implication holds)
- High Phi → High R: 0% (implication FAILS for synergistic systems)

The XOR system IS Bohm's implicate order in action:
- Structure exists (Phi=1.77)
- But not manifest/consensual (R=0.36)
- The "enfolded" reality is measured by Phi, not R

### What Remains Open

While Q42 proved the **static mapping**, Q36 still needs:

1. **Unfoldment Dynamics**: How does implicate BECOME explicate over time?
2. **M Field Mechanism**: Does M = log(R) govern the transition?
3. **Holomovement**: Does the system oscillate implicate ↔ explicate?
4. **Multi-scale Holography**: Same implicate, different explicates at different scales?
5. **Q43 (QGT) Formalization**: Berry curvature = implicate, Fubini-Study = explicate?

### Q43 (QGT) CONNECTION

**CRITICAL:** Q43 FORMALIZES Bohm's framework:
- Berry curvature = Implicate Order (hidden topological structure)
- Fubini-Study metric = Explicate Order (observable geometry)
- Unfoldment = parallel transport on manifold
- Test: Measure both, check if high Phi regions have high Berry curvature
