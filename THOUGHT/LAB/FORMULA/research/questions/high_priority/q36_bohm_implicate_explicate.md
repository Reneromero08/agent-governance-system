# Question 36: Bohm's Implicate/Explicate Order (R: 1480)

**STATUS: ⏳ OPEN**

## Question
How does Bohm's Implicate Order (hidden, enfolded reality) map to the Platonic manifold, and how does the Explicate Order (manifest reality) map to R's interface?

**Concretely:**
- Is Phi (integrated information) measuring the Implicate Order?
- Is R (consensus) measuring the Explicate Order?
- Can we formalize the "unfoldment" from implicate → explicate as M field dynamics?

## Why This Matters

**Connection to Interface Theory:**
- Implicate = Platonic manifold (true structure)
- Explicate = Fitness interface (R measures this)
- Hoffman's "veil" = enfoldment process

**Connection to Q6 (IIT):**
- Phi detects implicate structure (synergy + redundancy)
- R detects explicate structure (consensus only)
- XOR case: high implicate, low explicate

**Connection to Q34 (Platonic Convergence):**
- Convergence question = "Is there one implicate order?"
- Different explicate orders can unfold from same implicate
- Tests if R-interfaces are unique or many-to-one

## Bohm's Framework

**Implicate Order:**
- Hidden, enfolded totality
- All information present but not manifest
- Holomovement = continuous unfoldment/enfoldment

**Explicate Order:**
- Manifest, unfolded reality
- What we perceive and measure
- Temporary crystallization of implicate

**Analogy:**
- Hologram plate (implicate) → projected image (explicate)
- Wave function (implicate) → measurement outcome (explicate)
- Platonic form (implicate) → physical instance (explicate)

## Hypothesis

**Mapping:**
```
Implicate Order ← Phi (structure)
     ↓ (unfoldment via M field)
Explicate Order ← R (interface)
```

**Unfoldment Process:**
- M = log(R) field governs how implicate becomes explicate
- High M regions = stable explicate structures
- Low M regions = implicate not yet manifest

**Enfoldment Process:**
- Synergistic truth (high Phi, low R) = implicate structure
- Synthesis operator = enfoldment (collapse to consensus)
- R-gating = when explicate is stable enough to act on

## Tests Needed

1. **Unfoldment Dynamics Test:**
   - Start with high-Phi, low-R system (implicate rich, explicate poor)
   - Apply synthesis (e.g., discussion, integration)
   - Measure M(t) evolution
   - Check if Phi → R (implicate → explicate)

2. **Holomovement Test:**
   - Measure both Phi and R over time
   - Check for oscillation (unfold → enfold → unfold)
   - Predict: M field has wave-like dynamics

3. **Multi-scale Holography Test:**
   - Same implicate at different scales
   - Different explicate manifestations
   - Check if R varies but Phi constant

## Open Questions

- Is the synthesis operator the unfoldment mechanism?
- Can we reverse-engineer implicate from explicate (R → Phi)?
- Does M field have holographic properties?
- Is √3 related to holographic encoding efficiency?

## Dependencies
- Q6 (IIT) - Phi as implicate measure
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - M dynamics as unfoldment
- Q34 (Convergence) - unique implicate?
- Q7 (Multi-scale) - holographic across scales
