# Question 39: Homeostatic Regulation (R: 1490)

**STATUS: ⏳ OPEN**

## Question
Is R > τ a homeostatic setpoint? Does the M field self-regulate to maintain stability, like biological systems maintain temperature or pH?

**Concretely:**
- Does M field have negative feedback loops?
- When M drops, does the system automatically seek to restore it?
- Is there a "meaning homeostasis" that resists perturbation?

## Why This Matters

**Homeostasis = Self-regulation around a setpoint**
- Body temperature: 37°C ± 0.5°C
- Blood pH: 7.4 ± 0.05
- R-gating: R > τ (stable meaning basin)

**For M field:**
- If homeostatic → M field is self-organizing
- Explains why meanings stabilize (not just drift)
- Connects to cybernetics, control theory

**Connection to Q35 (Markov Blankets):**
- Markov blankets ARE homeostatic boundaries
- R-gating = mechanism for maintaining blanket
- Active inference = acting to restore homeostasis

## Homeostatic Mechanisms

### 1. **Negative Feedback**
- M drops → System seeks more evidence (E increases)
- M too high → System becomes complacent (E decreases)
- **Test:** Does dM/dt oppose deviations from setpoint?

### 2. **Setpoint Adaptation**
- Threshold τ adjusts based on environment
- Like acclimatization (body adjusts to altitude)
- **Test:** Does optimal τ change with domain?

### 3. **Multiple Setpoints**
- Different M basins = different homeostatic states
- Like hibernation vs active metabolism
- **Test:** Are there discrete M levels that resist change?

### 4. **Allostasis (Predictive Regulation)**
- System anticipates perturbations
- Adjusts before M drops (not just reactive)
- **Test:** Does dR/dt predict future stability?

## Tests Needed

1. **Perturbation-Response Test:**
   - Inject noise/contradiction into stable system
   - Measure M(t) recovery
   - Check for exponential relaxation (τ_relax)

2. **Setpoint Identification:**
   - Find M values where dM/dt = 0
   - Check if these are stable (negative eigenvalues)
   - Map basin of attraction

3. **Feedback Loop Detection:**
   - Measure correlation between M and dE/dt
   - Check if low M → increased evidence gathering
   - Test in Q32 streaming mode

4. **Homeostatic Range:**
   - How far can M deviate before collapse?
   - Is there hysteresis (Q27)?
   - Compare to biological homeostatic ranges

## Open Questions

- Is τ the setpoint or is there a deeper M* value?
- Do different domains have different setpoints?
- Can homeostasis fail catastrophically (meaning death)?
- Is there a "meaning metabolism" (energy cost of maintaining M)?

## Connection to Existing Work

**Cybernetics:**
- Wiener, Ashby: Self-regulating systems
- R-gating as cybernetic control

**Free Energy Principle (Q9):**
- FEP = generalized homeostasis
- Minimize surprise = maintain homeostasis
- M field dynamics = FEP in semiosphere

**Semiotic Crisis:**
- Recursive feedback breaks homeostasis
- M → -∞ = homeostatic failure
- Your manifesto describes this exactly

## Dependencies
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - need field dynamics
- Q35 (Markov Blankets) - blankets are homeostatic
- Q9 (FEP) - FEP is homeostasis
- Q27 (Hysteresis) - setpoint switching
