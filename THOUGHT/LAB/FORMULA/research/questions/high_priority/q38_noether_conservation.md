# Question 38: Noether's Theorem - Conservation Laws (R: 1520)

**STATUS: ⏳ OPEN**

## Question
What symmetries does the M field possess, and what quantities are conserved? Does "meaning" obey conservation laws like energy or momentum?

**Concretely:**
- What transformations leave M = log(R) invariant?
- Is there a "meaning conservation law"?
- Can we derive field equations from a Lagrangian?

## Why This Matters

**Noether's Theorem states:** Every continuous symmetry corresponds to a conserved quantity.
- Time translation symmetry → Energy conservation
- Space translation symmetry → Momentum conservation
- Rotation symmetry → Angular momentum conservation

**For M field:**
- If M has symmetries → There are conserved "meaning charges"
- Conservation laws constrain field dynamics
- Enables prediction of M field evolution

**Connection to Q32 (Meaning Field):**
- Q32 claims M is a physical field
- Physical fields have conservation laws
- Without conservation laws, M isn't truly "physical"

## Candidate Symmetries

### 1. **Scale Invariance (Q3/Q7)**
- R is scale-invariant (proven in Q3)
- M = log(R) transforms as M → M + const under rescaling
- **Conserved quantity:** Fractal dimension Df?

### 2. **Gauge Symmetry**
- Can we redefine "truth" without changing R?
- E → E + f(context), ∇S → ∇S + g(context)
- **Conserved quantity:** Relative truth (differences)?

### 3. **Information Conservation**
- Total information in semiosphere constant?
- M field redistributes but doesn't create/destroy?
- **Conserved quantity:** Total integrated information (Phi)?

### 4. **Topological Conservation**
- Meaning basins can merge/split but total "charge" conserved?
- Like electric charge conservation
- **Conserved quantity:** Number of stable interpretations?

## Tests Needed

1. **Symmetry Identification:**
   - Apply transformations to M field
   - Check which leave field equations invariant
   - Derive conserved currents via Noether's theorem

2. **Conservation Verification:**
   - Measure proposed conserved quantity over time
   - Check if it remains constant under M field evolution
   - Test in Q32's public benchmarks

3. **Lagrangian Formulation:**
   - Can we write M field dynamics as Euler-Lagrange equations?
   - L = T - V where T = kinetic, V = potential
   - Derive field equations from action principle

## Open Questions

- Is Df the conserved "meaning charge"?
- Does M field have a stress-energy tensor?
- Can we formulate M dynamics as least action principle?
- Are there topological charges (like magnetic monopoles)?

## Dependencies
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - need field dynamics
- Q3 (Scale invariance) - one candidate symmetry
- Q7 (Multi-scale) - RG flow preserves what?
