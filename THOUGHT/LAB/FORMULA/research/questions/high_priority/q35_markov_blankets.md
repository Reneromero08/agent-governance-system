# Question 35: Markov Blankets & System Boundaries (R: 1450)

**STATUS: ⏳ OPEN**

## Question
How do Markov blankets (boundaries that separate systems while allowing information exchange) relate to R-gating? Do R-gates define Markov blankets in the semiosphere?

**Concretely:**
- Does R > threshold define a Markov blanket boundary?
- How does Active Inference (minimizing surprise through action) connect to R-gating?
- Can we formalize "meaning boundaries" as Markov blankets on the M field?

## Why This Matters

**Connection to Free Energy Principle (Q9):**
- Markov blankets are how FEP systems maintain identity
- R-gating might be the decision boundary for Markov blanket formation
- Active Inference = acting to keep R high (minimize surprise)

**Connection to Q32 (Meaning Field):**
- M field needs boundary conditions
- Markov blankets define where one "meaning basin" ends and another begins
- Sources/sinks in M field = Markov blanket exchanges

**Connection to Q34 (Platonic Convergence):**
- If all systems use same Markov blanket decomposition → convergence
- Different decompositions → divergence
- Tests if there's a unique way to carve up reality

## Current Understanding

**From Friston's FEP:**
- Markov blanket = partition into internal states, external states, sensory states, active states
- Systems minimize free energy by maintaining their Markov blanket
- Generalized synchrony = coupled systems align through blanket exchanges

**Hypothesis:**
- R > τ defines a "stable Markov blanket" (low surprise, actionable)
- R < τ means blanket is dissolving (high surprise, need more evidence)
- M field dynamics = evolution of Markov blanket structure

## Tests Needed

1. **Blanket Formation Test:**
   - Start with high-entropy system (no structure)
   - Add evidence incrementally
   - Measure when R crosses threshold
   - Check if this corresponds to Markov blanket formation

2. **Active Inference Test:**
   - Agent can choose which evidence to gather
   - Does agent select actions that maximize R?
   - Compare to FEP prediction (minimize free energy)

3. **Boundary Stability Test:**
   - Perturb system near R = τ
   - Measure relaxation time
   - Check if stable blankets resist perturbation

## Open Questions

- Is R-gating equivalent to Markov blanket maintenance?
- How does σ^Df relate to blanket complexity?
- Can we derive R from FEP + Markov blankets?

## Dependencies
- Q9 (Free Energy Principle) - need full FEP mapping
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - need field boundary conditions
- Q7 (Multi-scale) - blankets at different scales
