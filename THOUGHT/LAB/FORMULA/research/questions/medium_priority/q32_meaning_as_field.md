# Question 32: Meaning as a physical field (R: 1450)

**STATUS: OPEN**

## Question
Is “meaning” just a label for compression/inference, or can it be defined as a **real, measurable field** with dynamics (like EM)?

Concretely:
- Give an operational definition of a “meaning field” that can be measured from data (not introspection).
- Define field variables, sources, coupling, and conservation/propagation laws (what is “charge/current”?).
- Produce at least one prediction that differs from standard information-theoretic / Bayesian accounts.

**Success criterion:** a quantitative model that makes novel, testable predictions (and can in principle be falsified).
