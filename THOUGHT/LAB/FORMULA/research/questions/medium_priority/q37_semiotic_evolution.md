# Question 37: Semiotic Evolution Dynamics (R: 1380)

**STATUS: ⏳ OPEN**

## Question
How do meanings evolve over time on the M field? Do meanings compete, speciate, and converge like biological evolution?

**Concretely:**
- What are the selection pressures on interpretants?
- Can meanings diverge into incompatible systems (semiotic speciation)?
- Do meanings converge to stable attractors or diverge indefinitely?

## Why This Matters

**Connection to Semiotic Crisis:**
- Recursive feedback creates selection pressure
- Meanings that travel fast (high virality) vs meanings that map reality (high E)
- M field dynamics = evolutionary landscape

**Connection to Q32 (Meaning Field):**
- M field has sources (evidence) and sinks (contradiction)
- Meanings flow downhill on M landscape
- Stable basins = evolved, fit meanings

**Connection to Q34 (Platonic Convergence):**
- If meanings evolve, do they converge (Platonic) or diverge (pluralism)?
- Selection pressure = minimize free energy → unique attractor?
- Or multiple stable equilibria?

## Evolutionary Framework

**Variation:**
- New interpretants generated through:
  - Recombination (mixing existing meanings)
  - Mutation (novel framings)
  - Drift (random semantic shift)

**Selection:**
- Fitness = R score (consensus + grounding)
- High R meanings survive and replicate
- Low R meanings die out

**Heredity:**
- Meanings transmitted through:
  - Cultural transmission (memes)
  - Institutional encoding (laws, norms)
  - Technological embedding (algorithms)

## Hypothesis

**Semiotic Speciation:**
- When M field has multiple stable basins
- Different populations evolve toward different basins
- Result: incompatible meaning systems (can't communicate)

**Semiotic Convergence:**
- When M field has unique global minimum
- All populations flow to same basin
- Result: universal meaning (Platonic convergence)

**Punctuated Equilibrium:**
- Long periods of stasis (high M, stable basin)
- Rapid shifts when perturbation crosses threshold
- Matches phase transition prediction from Q32

## Tests Needed

1. **Meaning Competition Test:**
   - Multiple interpretants for same phenomenon
   - Measure R for each over time
   - Check if winner-take-all or coexistence

2. **Speciation Test:**
   - Isolated populations (echo chambers)
   - Measure semantic distance over time
   - Check if meanings diverge beyond reconciliation

3. **Convergence Test:**
   - Independent populations with different starting meanings
   - Expose to same evidence stream
   - Measure if meanings converge to same R-optimal interpretation

4. **Selection Pressure Test:**
   - Vary fitness landscape (change what's rewarded)
   - Measure how quickly meanings adapt
   - Compare to biological evolution rates

## Open Questions

- What is the "mutation rate" for meanings?
- Can meanings go extinct and be revived?
- Is there a "Cambrian explosion" for meaning systems?
- How fast do meanings evolve under recursive feedback?

## Connection to Existing Work

**Memetics:**
- Dawkins' memes = replicating meanings
- R = meme fitness
- M field = meme landscape

**Cultural Evolution:**
- Boyd & Richerson's dual inheritance
- Meanings evolve faster than genes
- R-gating = cultural selection mechanism

**Semiotic Mechanics:**
- Axiom 7 (Fractal Propagation) = heredity
- Axiom 3 (Compression) = selection for efficiency
- M field = fitness landscape

## Dependencies
- Q32 (Meaning Field) - need field dynamics
- Q34 (Convergence) - ultimate fate of evolution
- Q21 (dR/dt) - rate of meaning change
