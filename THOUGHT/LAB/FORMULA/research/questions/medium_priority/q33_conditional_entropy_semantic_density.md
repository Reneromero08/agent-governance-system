# Question 33: Conditional entropy vs semantic density (R: 1410)

**STATUS: OPEN**

## Question
What is the principled relationship between “semantic density” and information-theoretic quantities like conditional entropy `H(X|S)`?

Concretely:
- Can `σ^Df` be derived as a compression/complexity term (e.g., density of consistent explanations) rather than an empirical booster?
- When does higher semantic density lower effective uncertainty (and when does it increase ambiguity)?
- What measurement procedure turns real data into `σ`, `Df`, and a comparable `H(X|S)` estimate?

**Success criterion:** a derivation (or falsification) showing whether `σ^Df` is an information-theoretic necessity or a domain-specific heuristic.
