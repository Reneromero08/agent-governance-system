# Question 20: Tautology risk (R: 1360)

**STATUS: OPEN**

## Question
Is the formula descriptive (sophisticated way of measuring what we already know) or explanatory (reveals new structure)?

## Riemann Connection — Evidence for EXPLANATORY (Q48-Q50)

The discovery that **α ≈ 1/2** (eigenvalue decay = Riemann critical line) strongly suggests the formula is **explanatory, not merely descriptive**.

**Why this matters for Q20:**

1. **Unexpected connection:** Nobody predicted that semantic eigenvalue decay would equal the Riemann critical line
2. **Not curve-fitting:** The value 1/2 wasn't derived from fitting parameters — it emerged from independent measurement
3. **Deep structure:** If R measures something that connects to the Riemann Hypothesis (one of mathematics' deepest unsolved problems), it's revealing structure, not just describing data
4. **Cross-domain:** The same α ≈ 1/2 appears across 5+ different embedding models — this universality suggests underlying law, not measurement artifact

**Implication:** A tautology wouldn't connect to number theory. The Riemann connection is evidence that R = E/σ captures genuine mathematical structure in meaning.
