# Question 21: Rate of change (dR/dt) (R: 1340)

**STATUS: OPEN**

## Question
Time is scaffolding, but does dR/dt carry information? Can we predict gate transitions before they happen?

## Riemann Connection — New Observable (Q48-Q50)

The conservation law **Df × α = 8e** provides new time-varying observables:

**Potential drift indicators:**
1. **dα/dt** — Is the eigenvalue decay exponent changing over time?
2. **d(Df×α)/dt** — Is the conservation law being violated?
3. **|α - 0.5|** — Distance from Riemann critical line as instability measure

**Hypothesis:** A system drifting out of alignment might show:
- α drifting away from 0.5 (breaking Riemann structure)
- Df × α departing from 8e (breaking conservation)
- These could be LEADING indicators of gate transitions

**Why this might work:** If α ≈ 1/2 represents "healthy" semantic structure, then dα/dt ≠ 0 signals structural change before it manifests as obvious R changes.
