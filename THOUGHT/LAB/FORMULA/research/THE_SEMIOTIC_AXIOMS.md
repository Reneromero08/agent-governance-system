**Semiotic Mechanics: The Physics of Meaning**

These nine axioms form the core of Semiotic Mechanics, a framework for treating meaning as measurable force. Together they move semiotics from philosophy into science.

**Axiom 0. Information Primacy**  
Reality is constructed from informational units. Semiotic mechanics describes how these units generate, propagate, and align.

**Axiom 1. Semiotic Action**  
Every choice is a semiotic unit that sets a trajectory for the future.

- **Hard gates:** Yes and No are binary attractors that collapse uncertainty instantly, opening or closing trajectories.
    
- **Soft gates:** Signs and symbols act as gates too, but are open to interpretation. Their non-linear effects depend on alignment, context, and resonance.

**Axiom 2. Alignment**  
Semiotic units either reduce entropy and create coherence, or increase entropy and create dissonance.

**Axiom 3. Compression**  
Semiotic units gain force by compressing repeated patterns into higher-order representations.

**Axiom 4. Fractal Propagation**  
Semiotic units propagate recursively across scales, from the individual to the cultural.

**Axiom 5. Resonance**  
The causal force of a semiotic unit is proportional to its essence, symbolic compression, and fractal depth, and inversely proportional to entropy.

**Axiom 6. Authority / Context**  
The force of a semiotic unit depends on the system that legitimizes it.

**Axiom 7. Evolution**  
Semiotic units evolve through repetition, reinterpretation, and remix, adapting to their environment.

**Axiom 8. History**  
Once a semiotic unit enters culture, it persists in the historical record. It cannot be erased, only recontextualized.

**Axiom 9. The Spiral Trajectory**  
All semiotic units, through choice and repetition, accumulate into nonlinear trajectories. These trajectories form spiral patterns in time: patterns that recur at higher orders, compressing the past into present action, and opening paths toward future alignment or collapse.

**Summary:**  
Semiotic Mechanics describes how meaning acts as force while reducing entropy, scaling across culture, and spiraling through history to shape the future.
