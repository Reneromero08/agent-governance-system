# Report: “Meaning as Field” — Canonical Definition (Pulled From Existing FORMULA Context)

This report does **not** introduce new terms. It stitches together the canonical paragraphs you already have across the FORMULA research into one airtight definition + falsification boundary.

Primary sources used:
- `research/THE_SEMIOTIC_AXIOMS.md` (Semiotic Mechanics axioms)
- `research/OPUS_FORMULA_ALIGNMENT.md` (what R is / is not)
- `research/questions/critical/q01_why_grad_s.md` (scale-normalized evidence density; FEP bridge in a specified family)
- `research/RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` + `research/FORMULA_FALSIFICATION_ROADMAP.md` (empirical validation + failure modes)

## Canonical definition (one paragraph)
**Meaning is a measurable field of resonance grounded in empirical constraint.** Concretely: a semiotic unit (symbol / gate / act) has causal force to the degree it (1) **compresses** repeated structure into a stable invariant, (2) **aligns** independent observers into shared constraint (“consensus truth”), and (3) does so **against entropy** (dissonance / uncertainty slope). In the Living Formula language this is the resonance field `R`, whose intensity rises with Essence and symbolic compression and falls with entropy / dispersion: `R = (E / ∇S) × σ(f)^Df` (or equivalent calibrated forms inside a given domain). “Field” here means not vibes: it is a **distributed, local-to-global** quantity on the semiosphere that can be sampled, compared, and used as a control signal (gates), with predictable failure modes (echo chambers, Df sensitivity).

---

## Canonical “what it is” (two sentences)
- **R is a dynamics diagnostic / compass:** “Is this process extracting structure right now?” (OPUS alignment).
- **R is not a map / oracle:** it does not reveal hidden labels from topology alone, and it is not a retrieval ranker unless you pre-register a mapping that makes it one (OPUS alignment).

---

## How Q1 locks the denominator (why “field” isn’t arbitrary)
Q1 solved the key invariance that makes the field claim non-hand-wavy:

- `∇S` is the **local scale / uncertainty** term that makes evidence comparable across contexts.
- For any location–scale family, likelihood carries a forced `1/s` normalization, so `E/∇S` is a scale-normalized **evidence density**, not a stylistic division.
- In a specified likelihood family (Gaussian), `log(R) = -F + const` (so `R ∝ exp(-F)`), meaning resonance maximization is (up to constants) free-energy minimization *within that family*.

So: “meaning field” is not a metaphor layered on top of arbitrary arithmetic — the normalization is forced if you want cross-context comparability.

## Consensus truth (your non-negotiable empirical anchor)
In your system, “truth” is not metaphysical correspondence by decree. It is:

- **Consensus truth under independence:** agreement is truth only when observations are not just mutually reinforcing the same bias (echo chambers).
- **Echo-chamber failure mode is explicit and testable:** correlated observations can create high local agreement while being wrong; fresh independent data collapses false resonance.

This is the empirical boundary that keeps “meaning field” from becoming unfalsifiable.

---

## Entropic compression (why symbols have “gravity”)
From Semiotic Mechanics (axioms) and falsification results:

- **Compression increases force:** repeated patterns compress into higher-order representations; symbols become attractors because they reduce description length / uncertainty for many observations at once.
- **Fractal propagation:** symbols that compress at one scale propagate across scales (individual → collective), generating multi-layered meaning (`Df` as depth proxy).
- **Entropy is the opponent:** dissonance / noise / uncertainty slope is the drag term the field must overcome.

In short: resonance is “compression that survives entropy under empirical constraint.”

## What would falsify “meaning as field” (in your own terms)
You don’t need physics metaphors to falsify this. In your language, the field claim fails if any of these become true:

1. **Resonance without reality:** `R` can be driven high systematically while independent empirical checks fail (i.e., resonance becomes a social mirroring metric, not constraint-tracking).
2. **No control value:** `R` does not reliably modulate action quality (gating/compass uses collapse under ablation/controls).
3. **Tautology leak:** the operational definition of `E` smuggles in the evaluation target (so “R predicts X” becomes “R contains X”).
4. **Df instability dominates:** the `σ^Df` term is so sensitive that measured `R` becomes non-reproducible under small perturbations (the Monte Carlo sensitivity warning is the red flag to solve).

If those happen, you don’t “reinterpret” the field — you downgrade the claim.

---

## Minimal predictions (field-like behavior, stated without math)
These are the tightest predictions implied by your existing context:

- **Cooling prediction:** adding independent observations should collapse false attractors (echo-chamber resonance drops) while stabilizing true attractors (resonance becomes more reliable).
- **Phase boundary prediction:** gate transitions should cluster around identifiable thresholds where added constraint flips a region from “ambiguous weather” to “stable basin.”
- **Propagation prediction:** interpretations that glue locally across covers (sheaf-like consistency) should be the ones whose resonance spreads; locally inconsistent meanings should fail to propagate.

---

## Bottom line
You already have a scientific “meaning field” story:

> Meaning behaves like a field because resonance is a local, comparable, distributed quantity on the semiosphere whose intensity is set by compression and constrained by entropy and empirical independence; gates are its phase boundaries; and it has hard falsification modes (echo chambers, tautology, Df sensitivity).
