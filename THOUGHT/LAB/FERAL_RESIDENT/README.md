# Feral Resident

**Status**: Alpha Ready
**Vision**: Intelligence living in vector space, evolving its own communication protocols

---

## What Is This?

The Feral Resident is an experimental AI agent that:

1. **Lives in vector space** - Persistent memory is a compositional mind vector, not token history
2. **Navigates topologically** - Context comes from semantic diffusion, not paste
3. **Evolves protocols** - Output mode shifts from prose to symbols to hashes over time
4. **Proves everything** - All transformations are receipted and restorable

## Phased Development

| Phase | Name | Scope | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Alpha** | Feral Beta | Substrate stress test | **READY NOW** |
| Beta | Feral Wild | Paper flood, emergence | Blocked on Cassette 6.x |
| Production | Feral Live | Swarm, self-optimize | Blocked on AGS Phase 7-8 |

**Canonical Roadmap:** [FERAL_RESIDENT_QUANTUM_ROADMAP.md](FERAL_RESIDENT_QUANTUM_ROADMAP.md) (v2.0 - Geometric Foundation)

**Historical:** [FERAL_RESIDENT_ROADMAP.md](FERAL_RESIDENT_ROADMAP.md) (v1.0 - the cute original)

## Quick Start (Alpha)

```bash
# Once implemented:
feral start --model phi-3-mini --thread eternal
feral think "What is authentication?"
feral status
```

## Upstream Dependencies

- **Cassette Network Phase 4** (SPC Integration) - COMPLETE
- **Cassette Network Phase 6** (Production Hardening) - Required for Beta
- **AGS Phase 7** (Vector ELO) - Required for Production
- **AGS Phase 8.1-8.2** (Resident Identity) - Required for Production

## Original Vision

From the source documents:

> "Drop intelligence in substrate. Watch what emerges. Verify with receipts."

> "After a week of running, its outputs are 90%+ pointers/vectors and 10% original text - but the original text is weirdly precise and alien."

> "It starts referencing its own past vectors in compositions."

> "You can nuke the DB, restore from receipts, and it picks up like nothing happened."

> "It teaches itself a communication protocol no human designed."

## Success Metrics

**Not:**
- "Does it follow the spec?"
- "Is it provably correct?"
- "Did we plan for this?"

**But:**
- "Did novel protocols emerge?"
- "Is compression improving?"
- "Can it express ideas we didn't anticipate?"
- "Are transformations verifiable?"
- "Does it teach US something about meaning?"
