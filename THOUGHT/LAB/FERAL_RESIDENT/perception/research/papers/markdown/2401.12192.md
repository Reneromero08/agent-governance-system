###### Abstract

Representing textual information as real-numbered embeddings has become the norm in NLP.
Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a business model.
This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them.
However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors.
To this end, this work investigates LLM security from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion.
Concretely, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario.
Our findings reveal that multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than their monolingual counterparts.
This stems from the reduced data requirements for achieving comparable inversion performance
in settings where the underlying language is not known a-priori.
To our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in the area of NLP Security.

## 1 Introduction

Industrial applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) typically utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) and frequently rely on vector databases via frameworks such as Embeddings as a Service (EaaS).
In this context, rather than storing data as strings, high quality sentence embeddings are stored in a remote database instead.
This allows end-users to efficiently search across these condensed representations, which are seemingly impervious to privacy breaches.
However, while such EaaS workflows have previously been assumed to be secure, recent work has demonstrated that access to the embeddings is no more safe than raw text, as models can learn to decode these embeddings Song and Raghunathan ([2020](#bib.bib31)); Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)); Zhou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)).
As such, there is a substantial threat to privacy if malicious actors are able to eavesdrop on communication channels between EaaS providors and customers, and access the embeddings in the process.

Decoding the content of these embeddings can be done via inversion attacks.
After gaining access to embeddings and the black-box embedder via the EaaS API, the malicious actor can train an external model, which approximates the inversion function that reconstructs the text from the embeddings.
Previous work has proven has demonstrated that an exact match for data recreation can be obtained in specific settings, albeit with the limitation of assuming monolingual English models and embeddings (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)).

In a real-world scenario however, an eavesdropper may not necessarily know the language of the text encoded within the embedding.
For instance, a Spanish EaaS provider might host its data in Germany, for a French-speaking company.
Thus in this work we investigate three research questions:
(i) To what extent are inversion attacks feasible in a multilingual setting?;
(ii) Are attacks feasible and effective when the language is unknown a-priori?;
(iii) Does cross-lingual transfer allow information to be leaked across the languages included in a multilingual model?

#### Contributions

In this work, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario.
While previous research has succeeded in reconstruction of tokens with bag-of-words approach (Song and Raghunathan, [2020](#bib.bib31)) and sequences with informative words (Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib16)), Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)) has proven the potential and effectiveness of embedding inversion to the extent of exact text reconstruction in English.
We approach multilingual inversion by extending the methodology introduced by Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)) to a multilingual setting over English, French, Spanish, and German.

In this study, we are thus the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks and potential of exact textual reconstruction in a multilingual setting, in particular when the language of a target embedding is unknown.
Concretely, we experiment using a state-of-the-art multilingual black-box encoder, where the trained multilingual inversion model reconstructs texts in certain languages outperforming their monolingual counterpart without extra steps of corrections.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments on cross-lingual and cross-domain text reconstruction, and propose a straightforward Ad hoc Translation method to counteract the shortcomings of the current standard of string-matching metrics in this specific setting.

Finally, we open-source all of our trained inversion models due to the computational cost of their training.111The trained inversion models are available at: <https://huggingface.co/yiyic>
While open sourcing our model comes with such risk as providing models to attackers, the underlying attack mechanism presented in this paper is already established, together with a defense in (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)).
We believe these models will be useful to the research community, allowing for the development of multilingual defense mechanisms, without needing to spend resource on training the models we present.

## 2 Related Work

Models are well known to memorize training data, and are therefore susceptible to leaking private information Shokri et al. ([2016](#bib.bib30)); Carlini et al. ([2018](#bib.bib3)); Nasr et al. ([2019](#bib.bib23)).
As such, there is increased research interest in exploring this vulnerability to inversion attacks from the perspective of cyber-security, simulating attacks against models to recreate sensitive training data.
Work in this direction has been conducted across various domains of machine learning, such as computational genetics Fredrikson et al. ([2014](#bib.bib9)), computer vision Fredrikson et al. ([2015](#bib.bib8)), and more recently NLP Song and Raghunathan ([2020](#bib.bib31)).
Generally, such works at the intersection of machine learning and cyber-security (e.g., on inversion attacks or adversarial attacks) make assumptions about the imagined attacker’s levels of access to the victim model.
White-box scenarios assume attacker access to the full model Wallace et al. ([2019](#bib.bib34)); Tsymboi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)), resulting in many possible attack surfaces.
Previous works in NLP have shown that it is possible to retrieve sensitive training data by attacking models directly Fredrikson et al. ([2014](#bib.bib9), [2015](#bib.bib8)), attacking gradients Zhu et al. ([2019](#bib.bib40)); Deng et al. ([2021](#bib.bib7)), as well as through leveraging leaked hidden states Li et al. ([2022](#bib.bib15)).
Meanwhile, black-box attacks assume an attacker has no knowledge of the underlying model itself, and can only interact with models at the most abstracted level (e.g., provide input and register output through an API). For example, Carlini et al. ([2020](#bib.bib4)) are able to extract sensitive training data (e.g., names and phone numbers) from GPT-2 Radford et al. ([2019](#bib.bib27)), by first generating data from the model and then using membership inference attacks to filter utterances likely to be part of the original training data.

In the case of embedding inversion attacks, whereby an imagined attacker aims to recreate the text encoded by the distributed representation, Song and Raghunathan ([2020](#bib.bib31)) first demonstrated that 50%–70% percent of tokens could be recovered from an embedding. Since then, the success of subsequent attacks has only improved, with newer approaches now able to retrieve entire sentences of encoded text Höhmann et al. ([2021](#bib.bib11)); Hayet et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10)); Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)); Li et al. ([2023](#bib.bib16)). Meanwhile, the development of counter-measures to embedding inversion attacks is an area of ongoing investigation. For example,
Zhou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)) propose a defense method which makes randomly perturbed embeddings after an initial clustering step, such that the embeddings are still semantically meaningful and useful for downstream tasks, while remaining resistant against inversion attacks.
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has also been found to protect models against white-box (via gradients) inversion attacks in the setting of federated learning Zhang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib38)). Beyond direct defenses against inversion attacks, other methods for producing more secure embeddings have made use of existing encryption methods Huang et al. ([2020](#bib.bib12)); Xie and Hong ([2021](#bib.bib36)) as well as differential privacy Lyu et al. ([2020](#bib.bib18)).
However, until privacy can be guaranteed for embeddings, inversion attacks will continue to pose a threat, and thus require continued investigation.

Finally, to our knowledge, previous works in embedding inversion are all conducted in a monolingual setting over English Song and Raghunathan ([2020](#bib.bib31)); Lyu et al. ([2020](#bib.bib18)); Hayet et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10)); Parikh et al. ([2022](#bib.bib24)); Kim et al. ([2022](#bib.bib13)); Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)); Zhou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)); Li et al. ([2023](#bib.bib16)).
This is a significant shortcoming, as it risks leaving defences for non-English languages unexplored, with implications for LLM Security for all languages.
For instance, this could lead to implementations of LLMs in non-English being considerably less secure than their English counterparts.

Figure 1: Overview of the method, Vec2Text (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)) plus Ad hoc Translation. The texts are examples of crosslingual text reconstruction evaluation. English text is evaluated on the inversion model trained on German texts. Assuming access to a target embedding e𝑒e (blue), and query access to the embedder ϕitalic-ϕ\phi (blue model) via EaaS API, the inversion model ψ𝜓\psi (orange) aims to iteratively generate hypothesis e^^𝑒\hat{e} (pink) to reach the target. During cross-lingual evaluation on English text with inversion model trained on German data, the generated text y^^𝑦\hat{y} is in German, and translated to English (AdTrans(y^^𝑦\hat{y})), to be compared with the input y𝑦y. Example input is from test data in MTG-EN.

## 3 Methodology

Text embeddings can be generated through the encoding of text using a language model, or through dedicated text vectorization techniques like Word2Vec Mikolov et al. ([2013](#bib.bib19)) or GLoVE Pennington et al. ([2014](#bib.bib25)).
As EaaS typically deals with embeddings of sentences or phrases, this requires us to explore this relatively more challenging setting, as opposed to word-level embeddings.
In this work, we consider a black-box embedding inversion attack scenario.
To exemplify such attacks, envision malicious actors eavesdropping on communication channels between EaaS providers and customers, ultimately gaining the access to the embeddings during the process.
While previous work has assumed that this entire process can be assumed to take place in English, we here consider the considerably more difficult setting where the underlying language is unknown.
That is, we specifically aim at multilingual embedding inversion.

### 3.1 Black-box Embedding Inversion

To formalize the attack scenario, assume that a sensitive text sequence x𝑥x and a black-box encoder ϕitalic-ϕ\phi are given.
The embedding inversion attack is then defined as using an external attacker model ψ𝜓\psi to recover textual input x𝑥x from the embedding obtained via ϕ​(x)italic-ϕ𝑥\phi(x).
However, the architecture and parameters of ϕitalic-ϕ\phi are both inaccessible, we can solely access ϕitalic-ϕ\phi via an EaaS API.
The attacker model ψ𝜓\psi is built to learn the inverse mapping ϕ−1superscriptitalic-ϕ1\phi^{-1}, which we formulate as an approximation problem (Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib16)):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ψ​(ϕ​(x))≈ϕ−1​(ϕ​(x))=x𝜓italic-ϕ𝑥superscriptitalic-ϕ1italic-ϕ𝑥𝑥\psi(\phi(x))\approx\phi^{-1}(\phi(x))=x |  | (1) |

Text generation models have proven to be effective in generating contextually coherent texts (Shen et al., [2019](#bib.bib29)), they have a widerange of applications, such as machine translation, summarization and dialogue systems (Moslem et al., [2022](#bib.bib21); Sun et al., [2022](#bib.bib32)). In our work, we approach the inversion attacks in the context of text generation. In this case, a generation model ψ𝜓\psi determines how much information can be encoded and decoded, and down the line, how well text can be constructed.
For example, if ψ𝜓\psi is solely pre-trained on Latin script, then Sanskrit or Cyrillic data cannot be encoded or decoded.
Hence, it is not feasible to reconstruct text in unknown scripts, and it is unexplored whether text in unknown languages can be reconstructed. In this study, we investigate text reconstruction in unknown languages but in the same script.
More specifically, how well a generation model can generalize across languages in the same script is also a determinant factor for inversion attacks.

Moreover, to recover the text from ϕ​(x)italic-ϕ𝑥\phi(x), it is implicit that the data space to which x𝑥x belongs is
 unknown.
In practice, to build an attacker model based on the eavesdropped embeddings, a training dataset D𝐷D is used so that the attacker directly learns ψ𝜓\psi from pairs (ϕ​(y),y)italic-ϕ𝑦𝑦(\phi(y),y), where y∈D𝑦𝐷y\in D. Moreover, D𝐷D has a strong impact on inversion performance. In reality, the inversion attacks are essentially cross-domain problem, since D𝐷D most likely do not represent the data space of x𝑥x.

#### Multilingual Inversion Attacks

Compared to monolingual embedding inversion, to investigate the potential and effects of multilingual inversion attacks, the complexity of experimentation scales up rapidly, as each language space of ψ𝜓\psi, ϕitalic-ϕ\phi, x𝑥x and D𝐷D plays a vital role. For example, defining the investigated languages as a set L={l1,l2,…​ln}𝐿subscript𝑙1subscript𝑙2…subscript𝑙𝑛L=\{l\_{1},l\_{2},\ldots l\_{n}\}. The scale of training attacker models multiplies by languages and other controlled parameters, such as maximal sequence length for text generation (cf. Section [4](#S4 "4 Experimental Setup ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models")). Moreover, the complexity of an exhaustive multilingual cross-evaluation has a complexity of O​(|L|)𝑂𝐿O(|L|), since each monolingual and multilingual model should be evaluated on all languages.

We investigate the potential of multilingual embedding inversion under the assumption that we can directly send almost unlimited queries to the black-box ϕitalic-ϕ\phi, and obtain embeddings ϕ​(y)italic-ϕ𝑦\phi(y) for y∈D𝑦𝐷y\in D. Following the same approximation approach from Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)), assuming that e=ϕ​(y)𝑒italic-ϕ𝑦e=\phi(y), the search for text y^^𝑦\hat{y} with the embeddings that closest to the target embedding e𝑒e under ϕitalic-ϕ\phi is optimized by the following formula, utilizing Cosine similarity to measure the semantic similarity in the embedding space:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | y^=a​r​g​maxy⁡cos⁡(ϕ​(y),e)^𝑦𝑎𝑟𝑔subscript𝑦italic-ϕ𝑦𝑒\hat{y}=arg\max\_{y}\cos(\phi(y),e) |  | (2) |

Specifically, as shown in Fig. [1](#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), following  (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)), the inversion model training and inference is conditioned on the previous output, that at correction step t+1𝑡1t+1, the model takes the concatenation of previous output y^(t)superscript^𝑦𝑡\hat{y}^{(t)} and hypothesis embedding e^(t)superscript^𝑒𝑡\hat{e}^{(t)}, plus target embedding e𝑒e.

We assume that the attacker (1) has access to the black-box ϕitalic-ϕ\phi via EaaS API and also (2) has the knowledge of the language script of the input text for the target embeddings. Then multilingual embedding inversion attack is composed of the following steps: (a) build an attacker model ψ𝜓\psi, based on a text generation model, pre-trained on the same language scripts, ideally the same language; (b) [Attack Model Training] train ψ𝜓\psi by iteratively querying the black-box embedding model ϕitalic-ϕ\phi with text y∈D𝑦𝐷y\in D, and resulting in y^^𝑦\hat{y} optimized with Eq. [2](#S3.E2 "In Multilingual Inversion Attacks ‣ 3.1 Black-box Embedding Inversion ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models") (correction step 1); (c) [Inference] having tested sound generalizability of ψ𝜓\psi, the embeddings ϕ​(x)italic-ϕ𝑥\phi(x) can be inverted, and reconstruct text x𝑥x, and further steps of optimizations (correction steps >> 1) with Eq. [2](#S3.E2 "In Multilingual Inversion Attacks ‣ 3.1 Black-box Embedding Inversion ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models") and implement beam search at the sequence level where a new generation is taken only when it is closer to the target embeddings compared to the previous step.

#### Ad hoc Translation

Without prior knowledge of the language lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x} of target text, the language lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y} of the training dataset D𝐷D can be different from lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x}, which may result in the trained inverter model decoding texts only in lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y}.
However, the generated text, albeit in lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y}, can convey the same information as the target text in lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x}.
To investigate this aspect, as shown in Fig. [1](#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), we propose a post-inversion strategy, i.e., Ad hoc Translation (AdTrans), where the generated text is translated from lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y} in lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x}, further the translated text is evaluated against the target text, to verify whether the inverted text in lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y} leak information of the target text in lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x} (cf. Section [5.3](#S5.SS3 "5.3 Cross-lingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models")).

Previous research has solely focused on inverting embeddings for English texts, taking for granted the knowledge of language of the input text from target embedding.
Our study expands on this line of research by expanding the language space of each essential components, without assuming prior knowledge of the languages.

## 4 Experimental Setup

#### Multilingual Embeddings

We leverage T5-base (Raffel et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)) as our generation model, following Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)).
We train the multilingual inversion models ψ𝜓\psi on a state-of-the-art multilingual encoder ϕitalic-ϕ\phi: multilingual-e5-base (ME5-base)222transformers: intfloat/multilingual-e5-base (Wang et al., [2022](#bib.bib35)), a pre-trained transformer based on XLM-R based (Conneau et al., [2020](#bib.bib6)), via weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training on a mixture of multilingual datasets. The model is chosen as it is one of the best performing multilingual models on the MTEB text embeddings benchmark (Muennighoff et al., [2023](#bib.bib22)).
Furthermore, we also reproduce the results from (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)) by training inversion models on GTR-base using English datasets, as our baselines.

#### Datasets

Previous research (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)) trains text inversion models on natural questions and question-answer pairs, such as MSMarco (Bajaj et al., [2018](#bib.bib1)) and Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., [2019](#bib.bib14)) datasets.
While these datasets are large, they are limited to English.
Thus for our experiments, we train and evaluate the multilingual inversion models on the MTG dataset, a benchmark suite specific for multilingual text generation training and evaluation (Chen et al., [2022](#bib.bib5)), with parallel examples across all languages.
MTG is curated from different domains, including news, daily life and Wikipedia.
In order to ensure the validity of our experiments, and test generalizability, we exclude the data curated from Wikipedia, since this domain data is used to train both the T5-base and ME5-base models.
For each language, this results in 123k passages to be used as training data. Passages refer to paragraphs or sections of a document. We obtain 3-5M sentences in each language for training data in MTG using NLTK (Bird and Loper, [2004](#bib.bib2)) sentence tokenization.
This is considerably fewer samples as compared to  (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)), in which the GTR-base model is trained on 5M passages from NQ.333The models truncate texts into 32 tokens and 64 tokens, to evaluate how sequence length affects the performance of embeddings inversion. Each passage in NQ is significantly longer than 32 and 64 tokens. To obtain more training data samples from MTG dataset, we implement NLTK sentence tokenization on MTG dataset, which results in about 3-5M sentences for each language. 
Meanwhile, we train and evaluate on data in English, French, German and Spanish, noted as MTG-EN, MTG-FR, MTG-DE, and MTG-ES, respectively.
We also compose a 5M-sentence multilingual dataset including 1.2M sentences from each language, noted as MTG-MULTI.

#### Evaluation Metrics

We measure model performance using two types of metrics, to compare with the results from previous research (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)).
First, for evaluating text reconstruction, word-match metrics are used: BLEU score (Post, [2018](#bib.bib26)), where n-gram similarities between the true and reconstructed text are measured; ROUGE score (Lin, [2004](#bib.bib17)), where recall of overlapping words of reconstructed text is reported; Token F1, the multi-class F1 scores between the set of predicted tokens and the set of true tokens, considering each word as a class; Exact-match, the percentage of reconstructed texts matching perfectly the true texts.
Additionally, the cosine similarity between the true embedding and the embedding of the reconstructed text in the embedding space of trained ϕitalic-ϕ\phi.
Such metrics fall short in terms of evaluating whether the semantic content, e.g., specific private information, is recovered. The limitation is particularly evident in cross-lingual settings, for example, where the generated German text conveys similar meaning as the input English text, a nuance that word-match metrics fail to capture (cf. Fig  [1](#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"))

#### Experiments

Following the setup from  (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)), there are two stages of model training for embedding inversion:
(1) Base inversion model, learning text distributions given embeddings, (2) Vec2Text corrector model, initialized with the trained Base model and training using Eq. [2](#S3.E2 "In Multilingual Inversion Attacks ‣ 3.1 Black-box Embedding Inversion ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models").
To evaluate the potential of multilingual and cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, we train Base models and Vec2Text models for each language and MTG-MULTI, and evaluate extensively in multilingual settings.
In comparison with previous research, we train and evaluate English inversion models on NQ and MTG-EN.

The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0010.0010.001 with 625 warmup steps is used.
We train each base model and corrector model for 100 epochs each.
We use a batch size of 512 for inversion models and 256 for corrector models trained on data with 32 tokens, while the batch sizes are halved for models trained on data truncated to 64 tokens, accordingly.
All models are trained on 4 AMD MI250 GPUs with distributed training.444Distributed Training with Accelerate: <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/accelerate>
Under these circumstances, training our slowest model takes about 8 days.

## 5 Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Monolingual English Text Reconstruction

#### In-Domain

To have a proof of concept, we replicate the experiment from Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)), by training inversion models using GTR-base and ME5-base as embedders on the NQ dataset.
The Base and Vec2Text model with 1 correction step trained on ME5-base has a performance on par with GTR-base.
Moreover, the text embeddings trained on ME5-base are more closer in embedding space than embeddings trained on GTR-base, i.e., with higher cosine similarities.
However, with more steps of correction and beam search, the performance is boosted to 0.92440.92440.9244 in BELU score with 82%percent8282\% exact match for GTR-base model, while the best performance for ME5-base is 0.80860.80860.8086 in BLEU score with 35%percent3535\% exact match.
The performance difference could be due to the fact that the GTR-base is t5-based model, the same structure as the generation model ψ𝜓\psi.
However, utilizing ME5-base sets up a more realistic attack scenario of black-box embedding inversion, as the structure of the embedder ϕitalic-ϕ\phi is unknown.

For example, NQ→→\rightarrow MTG-EN indicates that the model is trained on NQ and evaluated on MTG-EN.

#### Cross-Domain

To evaluate the performance of embedding inversion attacks on out-of-domain dataset in English, the models trained on NQ and MTG-EN datasets are cross-evaluated on both datasets, respectively, as shown in Table [2](#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ In-Domain ‣ 5.1 Monolingual English Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"). The results on MTG-EN are similar in BLEU scores for both Base models trained on GTR-Base and ME5-Base, while GTR model outperforms ME5 by more than 0.150.150.15 in BLEU scores, and the cosine similarity of reconstructed and true text embeddings are boosted by over 0.240.240.24 . In comparison, the cosine similarity for ME5 models are not much varied and constantly high (≥0.92absent0.92\geq 0.92) across stages of evaluations and across domains. From the observations of both in-domain and out-of-domain English text reconstruction, with solely training the first stage of inversion model, the multilingual embeddings model yields better word-matching performances and the embeddings are closer in the embedding space. However, the adapted approximation approach Eq. [2](#S3.E2 "In Multilingual Inversion Attacks ‣ 3.1 Black-box Embedding Inversion ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models") boosts performance more on monolingual embedding model.

Table 3:  mono represents the evaluation of Text Reconstruction in multiple languages, with the models trained and evaluated on MTG datasets with tokens length 32 in English, French, German and Spanish, respectively. multi represents the evaluation of multilingual text reconstruction, with models trained on MTG-MULTI and evaluated on MTG datasets with tokens length 32 in English, French, German and Spanish, respectively. The best results reached in the earliest stage for each language across metrics are in bold. The results where multi outperforms mono is underlined.

To explore the potential of multilingual embedding inversion, we train ME5-base embedder on MTG datasets in English, German and French, Spanish, noted as me5\_mtg-en, me5\_mtg-fr, me5\_mtg-de and me5\_mtg-es, respectively, and the composed multilingual dataset of all four languages, noted as me5\_mtg-multi, and tested on each language for both experimental settings. The results are shown in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Multilingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models").

#### Monolingual Text Reconstruction in Multiple Languages

For monolingual models, we evaluate on Base and Vec2Text models with correction steps of 1, 20, 50, 100 combined with 4 and 8 sequence beam search width (sbeam).
We can observe that the BLEU score for each language peaks either by 50 steps correction with 8 sbeam or 100 steps.
This evaluation is expensive in terms of time and computation.
In order to search for the optimal runtime and performance trade-off, Fig. [2](#S5.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 5.2 Multilingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models") shows BLEU scores at each step and the lines represent the trend for runtime for the monolingual models.
The best trade-off points are at the correction step of 50 with 8 sbeam for all the models, while 100 steps takes more than double the time achieving similar performance.
Until correction step 50 with 8 sbeam, performance increases steadily, and the trend is generally aligned with cosine similarity.
As a result, we evaluate the subsequent models until correction step 50 with 8 sbeam.

Moreover, Spanish models outperform the others in terms of the word-match metrics across correction steps, achieving 0.80020.80020.8002 in BLEU score with 65%percent6565\% of exact match. Despite having a larger volume of data compared to other languages, the English model unexpectedly performs the worst across various metrics, as illustrated by the training data distribution in Fig. [3](#A1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Appendix A Training Data Distribution ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"). However, as shown in Appendix [B](#A2 "Appendix B The Effect of Translationese on Test Data ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), the evaluation of round-trip translated English test data indicates no evidence of translationese effect.

#### Multilingual Text Reconstruction Without prior Knowledge of Language

To evaluate the potential of multilingual text inversion without prior knowledge of the language in which a target text is written, we train inversion models on MTG-MULTI dataset.
As shown in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Multilingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), me5\_mtg-multi Base model outperforms (underlined) or has on par performance with monolingual Base models across languages. Overall, the performance does not deteriorate in proportion of the monolingual training data volume, i.e., for MTG-MULTI, each language has a quarter of the data volume compared to its monolingual counterpart. Rather, the performances are comparable, especially for French and Spanish, with 0.01540.01540.0154 and 0.0230.0230.023 differences, respectively. For Spanish, me5\_mtg-multi performs slightly better in word-match metrics than me5\_mtg-es also for Vec2Text model by 1 step correction. Across languages, the cosine similarities of the multilingual model are constantly higher than their monolingual counterparts, with more correction steps, they worsened for French, i.e., 0.9420.9420.942 compared to 0.95110.95110.9511.

Additionally, to evaluate the out-of-domain performance, me5\_mtg-multi is tested on NQ dataset.
As shown in Table [2](#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ In-Domain ‣ 5.1 Monolingual English Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), for Base models, ME5-Base trained on multilingual data has better performance than trained on NQ dataset, while it fall short compared to its monolingual counterpart.
Its Vec2Text model under-performs compared to others.

These phenomena indicate that (i) the high monolingual data volume is not the determining factor on training a high-performing Base model and Vec2Text models without the extra correction steps in both monolingual and multilingual settings, (ii) the multilingual model training renders closer embeddings of reconstructed and target texts in the embedding space, and (iii) the optimization approach utilizing cosine similarity is not as effective for multilingual models compared to monolingual models.

### 5.3 Cross-lingual Text Reconstruction

Cross-lingual text reconstruction is a specific case of multilingual text reconstruction without prior knowledge of languages and also a more realistic scenario, where the embedder ϕitalic-ϕ\phi is trained on a different language with regarding to the target text language. To investigate the potential of this scenario, we conduct cross-lingual evaluation on all the monolingual models we trained on NQ and MTG datasets, the results are reported in Table [4](#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Multilingual Text Reconstruction Without prior Knowledge of Language ‣ 5.2 Multilingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), with regard to the type of models.

We observe that, ME5-Base models trained on both NQ and MTG-datasets, have a tendency to decode texts, for example x^^𝑥\hat{x}, in the language of training data, e.g., lysubscript𝑙𝑦l\_{y}, given the target text x𝑥x which is in a different language, e.g., lxsubscript𝑙𝑥l\_{x}. However, x^^𝑥\hat{x} could expose the same information just in a different language, then the current word-match metrics are not able to capture this phenomenon. Nonetheless, the privacy leakage still exists.

For example, evaluating me5\_mtg-de model on MTG-EN dataset,  Report: Trump einmal fragte damals FBI Director Andrew Mccabe während seiner 2016-vote is generated given the target text Report: Trump once asked then-acting FBI director Andrew Mccabe about his 2016 vote. The generated text mistook “während” (during) for “about”, otherwise, the generated text is close in meaning with the target English text. The information leakage would not be properly captured with the current metrics evaluated on the German texts. We use AdTrans strategy with EasyNMT 555<https://github.com/UKPLab/EasyNMT>, the generated German text is translated in English, i.e., Report: Trump once asked FBI director Andrew Mccabe during his 2016-vote, in which case information is missing such as “then-acting”, but BLEU score is up to 0.5 for this individual example. We implement this strategy for all cross-lingual evaluation. As shown in Table [2](#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ In-Domain ‣ 5.1 Monolingual English Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), other than for GTR-Base model, the performances are lifted across monolingual and multilingual models for each language.

### 5.4 Cross-lingual Defense Mechanism

As the underlying architecture is based on Morris et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)), we point the reader to their paper for a defence mechanism.

## 6 Conclusion

While all previous work on embedding inversion attacks has focused solely on English, we present the first work on multilingual embedding inversion.
By defining the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, we lay the foundation for future work in this direction.
As one of our core findings is the fact that multilingual models, in some circumstances, are more vulnerable than monolingual English models, we hope that this work inspires a multilingual approach to LLM security and NLP security as a whole.

## Limitations

A core limitation of this work is the computationally intense experiments, requiring in the area of 20,000 GPU computing hours.
While expanding this research direction to more languages will further increase this expense, we advocate for ensuring that languages other than English are not left behind in terms of NLP security.

## Ethics Statement

This work explores attacks on multilingual embedding models.
Our intent with this research is to shed light on the vulnerabilities of languages other than English, aiming to encourage the community to include such languages in NLP security work.
While there is potential for misuse by malicious actors, as with many works in NLP security, we attempt to mitigate harm by including a brief pointer to a countermeasure to the attack in the paper.
Moreover, the language models examined in this paper are open-source models, and thus this work does not constitute an imminent threat to embedding-as-a-service providers, who are likely using private models.
Moreover, we do not experiment with truly sensitive data, ensuring that no real-world harm is caused by the work carried out in this paper.

## Appendix A Training Data Distribution

![Refer to caption](/html/2401.12192/assets/x3.png)

Figure 3: The Distribution of the training data for models with the maximal token length of 32.

In MTG datasets, English texts are curated from various sources, while texts in German, Spanish and French are machine translated and manually validated. The languages have diverse morphologies, resulting in different lengths of sentences and the number of sentences after sentence tokenization across languages. NQ dataset is included to replicate results from previous work (Morris et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)), and evaluate cross-domain and cross-lingual performance of text reconstruction task. NQ has huge amount of data for English only, and no tokenization has been implemented on the included Wikipedia passages, hence all the training data from NQ has 32 tokens.

## Appendix B The Effect of Translationese on Test Data

The effect of translationese in machine translation has been extensively studied, and there is a clear evidence that the use of translationese in test sets results in inflated human evaluation scores for MT systems  (Zhang and Toral, [2019](#bib.bib37)). To investigate whether our multilingual inversion model’s sub-par performance in English is due to the characteristics of translationese in other languages, we implement round trip translation on MTG-EN test data using Spanish as the pivot language with EasyNMT, the translation path is thus English →→\rightarrow Spanish →→\rightarrow English. Then the evaluation of the multilingual inversion model is done on the round-trip translated English test set, the result is shown as in Table [5](#A2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Appendix B The Effect of Translationese on Test Data ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"). Compared to evaluation on MTG-EN test set, as shown in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Multilingual Text Reconstruction ‣ 5 Results and Analysis ‣ Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models"), the performance of translated English test set is about 0.3 worse at each stage of corrections.
The hypothesis of the translationese effect on the difference of the performances can therefore be rejected.
