> Abstract:This paper presents a comprehensive study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tracing its evolution from foundational concepts to the current state of the art. RAG combines retrieval mechanisms with generative language models to enhance the accuracy of outputs, addressing key limitations of LLMs. The study explores the basic architecture of RAG, focusing on how retrieval and generation are integrated to handle knowledge-intensive tasks. A detailed review of the significant technological advancements in RAG is provided, including key innovations in retrieval-augmented language models and applications across various domains such as question-answering, summarization, and knowledge-based tasks. Recent research breakthroughs are discussed, highlighting novel methods for improving retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, the paper examines ongoing challenges such as scalability, bias, and ethical concerns in deployment. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on improving the robustness of RAG models, expanding the scope of application of RAG models, and addressing societal implications. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners in understanding the potential of RAG and its trajectory in natural language processing.
