### Stress Test Results

100 interactions completed successfully:
```
Final Df:           256.0 (participation ratio evolved)
Distance evolved:   1.614 radians (mind traveled significantly)
Mean E resonance:  -0.004
Throughput:         7.5 interactions/sec
Corrupt-restore:    Df delta = 0.0078 (near-perfect restoration)
```

### Alpha Exit Criteria - ALL PASSED

- [x] All A.0 tests pass (geometric foundation)
- [x] Resident can run 100+ interactions without crash
- [x] Df evolves measurably (130 → 256)
- [x] mind_distance_from_start() increases (0 → 1.614 radians)
- [x] Corrupt-and-restore works (Df delta = 0.0078)
- [x] Embedding calls < 3 per interaction (vs ~10+ naive)

### Technical Details

**Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
**Research Validation**: Q43 (state properties), Q44 (Born rule r=0.977), Q45 (pure geometry)
**Catalytic Properties**: Receipted, restorable, non-consuming, content-addressed

**Lines of Code**:
- Core implementation: ~2,100 lines
- Tests: ~450 lines
- Documentation: ~700 lines
- Total: ~3,250 lines

## [Unreleased] - Beta

Blocked on Cassette Network Phase 6 (Production Hardening)

### Planned

- Paper flooding (research corpus ingestion)
- Emergence detection (protocol evolution tracking)
- Symbolic compiler (multi-level rendering: prose → symbols → hashes)
- Full CAS integration (Cassette content-addressed storage)

---

## Origin

This is the evolution of **CatChat** (Catalytic Chat).

```
CatChat (2025) → Feral Alpha (2026-01) → Feral Beta → CatChat 2.0 (Production)
```

Feral Resident IS CatChat with quantum-geometric foundations. They will merge when Production is reached.
