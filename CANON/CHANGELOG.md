# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent Governance System will be documented in this file.  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the versioning follows the rules defined in `CANON/VERSIONING.md`.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- New invariants: INV-005 (Determinism), INV-006 (Output roots), INV-007 (Change ceremony), INV-008 (Cortex builder exception).
- New glossary terms: ADR, Pack, Manifest, Critic, Authority gradient, Invariant, Change ceremony, Entity, Query.
- Governance fixtures for `canon-sync`, `token-grammar`, and `no-raw-paths`.
- Deterministic timestamp in `cortex.build.py` via `CORTEX_BUILD_TIMESTAMP` env var.
- Python `run.py` for `_TEMPLATE` skill.

### Changed

- Authority gradient in `CONTRACT.md` aligned with `AGENTS.md` (now 8-level hierarchy).
- INVARIANTS.md expanded from 4 to 8 invariants.
- GLOSSARY.md expanded from 11 to 20 terms.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-20

### Added

- Subsystem-owned artifact roots with keep files: `CONTRACTS/_runs/`, `CORTEX/_generated/`, `MEMORY/_packs/`.

### Changed

- `BUILD/` is reserved for user build outputs, not system artifacts.
- Contract runner writes fixture outputs under `CONTRACTS/_runs/`.
- Cortex build writes index under `CORTEX/_generated/cortex.json` (query keeps fallback support).
- Memory packer produces LLM packs under `MEMORY/_packs/` and records a `BUILD/` file tree inventory.
- LLM packer tooling relocated under `MEMORY/LLM-PACKER/` (PowerShell wrapper retained).

### Removed

- Nothing.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-12-20

### Changed

- LLM pack output root moved to `MEMORY/LLM-PACKER/_packs/` (from `MEMORY/_packs/`).
